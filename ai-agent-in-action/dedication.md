# dedication

*I dedicate this book to all the readers who embark on this journey with me.  
Books are a powerful way for an author to connect with readers on a deeply personal  
level, chapter by chapter, page by page. In that shared experience of learning,  
exploring, and growing together, I find true meaning. May this book inspire you  
and challenge you, and help you see the incredible potential that AI agents hold—  
not just for the future but also for today.*
