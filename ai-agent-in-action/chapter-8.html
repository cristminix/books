   <p>Now that we’ve explored agent actions using external tools, such as plugins in the form of native or semantic functions, we can look at the role of memory and knowledge using retrieval in agents and chat interfaces. We’ll describe memory and knowledge and how they relate to prompt engineering strategies, and then, to understand memory knowledge, we’ll investigate document indexing, construct retrieval systems with LangChain, use memory with LangChain, and build semantic memory using Nexus.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>Retrieval in agent and chat applications is a mechanism for obtaining knowledge to keep in storage that is typically external and long-lived. Unstructured knowledge includes conversation or task histories, facts, preferences, or other items necessary for contextualizing a prompt. Structured knowledge, typically stored in databases or files, is accessed through native functions or plugins.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10"> &#13;
   <p>Memory and knowledge, as shown in figure 8.1, are elements used to add further context and relevant information to a prompt. Prompts can be augmented with everything from information about a document to previous tasks or conversations and other reference information.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p12"> &#13;
   <p>The prompt engineering strategies shown in figure 8.1 can be applied to memory and knowledge. Knowledge isn’t considered memory but rather an augmentation of the prompt from existing documents. Both knowledge and memory use retrieval as the basis for how unstructured information can be queried.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13"> &#13;
   <p>The retrieval mechanism, called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), has become a standard for providing relevant context to a prompt. The exact mechanism that powers RAG also powers memory/knowledge, and it’s essential to understand how it works. In the next section, we’ll examine what RAG is.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_105"><span class="num-string">8.2</span> The basics of retrieval augmented generation (RAG)</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p15"> &#13;
   <p>RAG has become a popular mechanism for supporting document chat or question-and-answer chat. The system typically works by a user supplying a relevant document, such as a PDF, and then using RAG and a large language model (LLM) to query the document.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 8.2 shows how RAG can allow a document to be queried using an LLM. Before any document can be queried, it must first be loaded, transformed into context chunks, embedded into vectors, and stored in a vector database.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p17">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 8.2</span> The two phases of RAG: first, documents must be loaded, transformed, embedded, and stored, and, second, they can be queried using augmented generation.</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>A user can query previously indexed documents by submitting a query. That query is then embedded into a vector representation to search for similar chunks in the vector database. Content similar to the query is then used as context and populated into the prompt as augmentation. The prompt is pushed to an LLM, which can use the context information to help answer the query.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19"> &#13;
   <p><em>Unstructured</em> memory/knowledge concepts rely on some format of text-similarity search following the retrieval pattern shown in figure 8.2. Figure 8.3 shows how memory uses the same embedding and vector database components. Rather than preload documents, conversations or parts of a conversation are embedded and saved to a vector database.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p21"> &#13;
   <p>The retrieval pattern and document indexing are nuanced and require careful consideration to be employed successfully. This requires understanding how data is stored and retrieved, which we’ll start to unfold in the next section.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p>Document indexing transforms a document’s information to be more easily recovered. How the index will be queried or searched also plays a factor, whether searching for a particular set of words or wanting to match phrase for phrase.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p24"> &#13;
   <p>A <em>semantic</em> search is a search for content that matches the searched phrase by words and meaning. The ability to search by meaning, semantically, is potent and worth investigating in some detail. In the next section, we look at how vector similarity search can lay the framework for semantic search.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p26"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s look now at how a document can be transformed into a <em>semantic vector,</em> or a representation of text that can then be used to perform distance or similarity matching. There are numerous ways to convert text into a semantic vector, so we’ll look at a simple one.</p> &#13;

   <p>Open the <code>chapter_08</code> folder in a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) workspace. Create a new environment and <code>pip</code> <code>install</code> the <code>requirements.txt</code> file for all the chapter dependencies. If you need help setting up a new Python environment, consult appendix B.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p28"> &#13;
   <p>Now open the <code>document_vector_similarity.py</code> file in VS Code, and review the top section in listing 8.1. This example uses Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF). This numerical statistic reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or set of documents by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and offset by the frequency of the word in the document set. TF–IDF is a classic measure of understanding one document’s importance within a set of documents.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p30"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s break down TF–IDF into its two components using the sample sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful,” and focusing on the word <em>blue</em>.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p31"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">Term Frequency (TF)</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p32"> &#13;
   <p><em>Term Frequency</em> measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Because we’re considering only a single document (our sample sentence), the simplest form of the TF for <em>blue</em> can be calculated as the number of times <em>blue</em> appears in the document divided by the total number of words in the document. Let’s calculate it:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p33"> &#13;
   <p>Number of times <em>blue</em> appears in the document: 1</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p34"> &#13;
   <p>Total number of words in the document: 6</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p35"> &#13;
   <p>TF = 1 ÷ 6TF = .16</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p36"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p37"> &#13;
   <p><em>Inverse Document Frequency</em> measures how important a term is within the entire corpus. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term and then taking the logarithm of that quotient:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p38"> &#13;
   <p>IDF = log(Total number of documents ÷ Number of documents containing the word)</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p39"> &#13;
   <p>In this example, the corpus is a small collection of eight documents, and <em>blue</em> appears in four of these documents.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p40"> &#13;
   <p>IDF = log(8 ÷ 4)</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p41"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">TF–IDF calculation</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p42"> &#13;
   <p>Finally, the TF–IDF score for <em>blue</em> in our sample sentence is calculated by multiplying the TF and the IDF scores:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p43"> &#13;
   <p>TF–IDF = TF × IDF</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p44"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s compute the actual values for TF–IDF for the word <em>blue</em> using the example provided; first, the term frequency (how often the word occurs in the document) is computed as follows:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p45"> &#13;
   <p>TF = 1 ÷ 6</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p46"> &#13;
   <p>Assuming the base of the logarithm is 10 (commonly used), the inverse document frequency is computed as follows:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p47"> &#13;
   <p>IDF = log10 (8 ÷ 4)</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p48"> &#13;
   <p>Now let’s calculate the exact TF–IDF value for the word <em>blue</em> in the sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful”:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p49"> &#13;
   <p>The Term Frequency (TF) is approximately 0.1670.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p50"> &#13;
   <p>The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is approximately 0.301.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text indented-paragraph equation-paragraph" id="p51"> &#13;
   <p>Thus, the TF–IDF (TF × IDF) score for <em>blue</em> is approximately 0.050.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p52"> &#13;
   <p>This TF–IDF score indicates the relative importance of the word <em>blue</em> in the given document (the sample sentence) within the context of the specified corpus (eight documents, with <em>blue</em> appearing in four of them). Higher TF–IDF scores imply greater importance. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p53"> &#13;
   <p>We use TF–IDF here because it’s simple to apply and understand. Now that we have the elements represented as vectors, we can measure document similarity using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a measure used to calculate the cosine of the angle between two nonzero vectors in a multidimensional space, indicating how similar they are, irrespective of their size.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p54"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 8.4 shows how cosine distance compares the vector representations of two pieces or documents of text. Cosine similarity returns a value from –1 (not similar) to 1 (identical). <em>Cosine distance</em> is a normalized value ranging from 0 to 2, derived by taking 1 minus the cosine similarity. A cosine distance of 0 means identical items, and 2 indicates complete opposites.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Run this exercise to see the output (F5 in VS Code). Enter any text you like, and see the results of documents being returned. This search form works well for matching words and phrases with similar words and phrases. This form of search misses the word context and meaning from the document. In the next section, we’ll look at a way of transforming documents into vectors that better preserves their semantic meaning.</p> &#13;

   <p>TF–IDF is a simple form that tries to capture semantic meaning in documents. However, it’s unreliable because it only counts word frequency and doesn’t understand the relationships between words. A better and more modern method uses document embedding, a form of document vectorizing that better preserves the semantic meaning of the document.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p68"> &#13;
   <p>Embedding networks are constructed by training neural networks on large datasets to map words, sentences, or documents to high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships based on context and relationships in the data. You typically use a pretrained model trained on massive datasets to embed documents and perform embeddings. Models are available from many sources, including Hugging Face and, of course, OpenAI.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p69"> &#13;
   <p>In our next scenario, we’ll use an OpenAI embedding model. These models are typically perfect for capturing the semantic context of embedded documents.

   <p>Retrieval mechanisms augment the context of a given prompt with specific information relevant to the request. For example, you may request detailed information about a local document. With earlier language models, submitting the whole document as part of the prompt wasn’t an option due to token limitations.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p89"> &#13;
   <p>Today, we could submit a whole document for many commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo, as part of a prompt request. However, the results may not be better and would likely cost more because of the increased number of tokens. Therefore, a better option is to split the document and use the relevant parts to request context—precisely what RAG and memory do.</p> &#13;

   <p>Memory in agents and AI applications is often described in the same terms as cognitive memory functions. <em>Cognitive </em>memory describes the type of memory we use to remember what we did 30 seconds ago or how tall we were 30 years ago. Computer memory is also an essential element of agent memory, but one we won’t consider in this section.</p> &#13;

   <p>The reason we need an agent (LLM) was shown in figure 8.14 earlier.

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p145"> &#13;
   <p>Psychologists categorize memory into multiple forms, depending on what information is remembered. Semantic, episodic, and procedural memory all represent different types of information. <em>Episodic</em> memories are about events, <em>procedural</em> memories are about the process or steps, and <em>semantic</em> represents the meaning and could include feelings or emotions. Other forms of memory (geospatial is another), aren’t described here but could be. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p146"> &#13;
   <p>Because these memories rely on an additional level of categorization, they also rely on another level of semantic categorization. Some platforms, such as Semantic Kernel (SK), refer to this as <em>semantic memory</em>. This can be confusing because semantic categorization is also applied to extract episodic and procedural memories.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p147"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 8.17 shows the semantic memory categorization process, also sometimes called semantic memory. The difference between semantic memory and regular memory is the additional step of processing the input semantically and extracting relevant questions that can be used to query the memory-relevant vector database.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Figure 8.18 shows how to configure a new memory store using semantic memory. As of yet, you can’t configure the specific function prompts for memory, augmentation, and summarization.

   <p>Memory and knowledge can significantly assist an agent with various application types. Indeed, a single memory/knowledge store could feed one or multiple agents, allowing for further specialized interpretations of both types of stores. We’ll finish out the chapter by discussing memory/knowledge compression next.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p156"> &#13;
   <p>Much like our own memory, memory stores can become cluttered with redundant information and numerous unrelated details over time. Internally, our minds deal with memory clutter by compressing or summarizing memories. Our minds remember more significant details over less important ones, and memories accessed more frequently.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p157"> &#13;
   <p>We can apply similar principles of memory compression to agent memory and other retrieval systems to extract significant details. The principle of compression is similar to semantic augmentation but adds another layer to the preclusters groups of related memories that can collectively be summarized.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p158"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 8.20 shows the process of memory/knowledge compression. Memories or knowledge are first clustered using an algorithm such as k-means. Then, the groups of memories are passed through a compression function, which summarizes and collects the items into more succinct representations. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p162"> &#13;
   <p>Compressing memories and even knowledge is generally recommended if the number of items in a cluster is large or unbalanced. Each use case for compression may vary depending on the use and application of memories. Generally, though, if an inspection of the items in a store contains repetitive or duplicate information, it’s a good time for compression. The following is a summary of use cases for applications that would benefit from compression.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p163"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">The case for knowledge compression</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p164"> &#13;
   <p>Knowledge retrieval and augmentation have also been shown to benefit significantly from compression. Results will vary by use case, but generally, the more verbose the source of knowledge, the more it will benefit from compression. Documents that feature literary prose, such as stories and novels, will benefit more than, say, a base of code. However, if the code is likewise very repetitive, compression could also be shown to be beneficial.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p165"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">The case for how often you apply compression</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p166"> &#13;
   <p>Memory will often benefit from the periodic compression application, whereas knowledge stores typically only help on the first load. How frequently you apply compression will greatly depend on the memory use, frequency, and quantity.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p167"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">The case for applying compression more than once</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p168"> &#13;
   <p>Multiple passes of compression at the same time has been shown to improve retrieval performance. Other patterns have also suggested using memory or knowledge at various levels of compression. For example, a knowledge store is compressed two times, resulting in three different levels of knowledge. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p169"> &#13;
   <h4 class="readable-text-h4 sigil_not_in_toc">The case for blending knowledge and memory compression</h4> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p170"> &#13;
   <p>If a system is specialized to a particular source of knowledge and that system also employs memories, there may be further optimization to consolidate stores. Another approach is to populate memory with the starting knowledge of a document directly.</p> &#13;

   <p>In more advanced systems, we’ll look at agents employing multiple memory and knowledge stores relevant to their workflow. For example, an agent could employ individual memory stores as part of its conversations with individual users, perhaps including the ability to share different groups of memory with different groups of individuals.

   <li class="readable-text" id="p206"> Memory in AI applications differentiates between unstructured and structured memory, highlighting their use in contextualizing prompts for more relevant interactions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p207"> Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a mechanism for enhancing prompts with context from external documents, using vector embeddings and similarity search to retrieve relevant content. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p208"> Semantic search with document indexing converts documents into semantic vectors using TF–IDF and cosine similarity, enhancing the capability to perform semantic searches across indexed documents. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p209"> Vector databases and similarity search stores document vectors in a vector database, facilitating efficient similarity searches and improving retrieval accuracy. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p210"> Document embeddings capture semantic meanings, using models such as OpenAI’s models to generate embeddings that preserve a document’s context and facilitate semantic similarity searches. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p211"> LangChain provides several tools for performing RAG, and it abstracts the retrieval process, allowing for easy implementation of RAG and memory systems across various data sources and vector stores. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p212"> Short-term and long-term memory in LangChain implements conversational memory within LangChain, distinguishing between short-term buffering patterns and long-term storage solutions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p213"> Storing document vectors in databases for efficient similarity searches is crucial for implementing scalable retrieval systems in AI applications. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p214"> Agent knowledge directly relates to the general RAG pattern of performing question and answer on documents or other textual information. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p215"> Agent memory is a pattern related to RAG that captures the agentic interactions with users, itself, and other systems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p216"> Nexus is a platform that implements agentic knowledge and memory systems, including setting up knowledge stores for document retrieval and memory stores for various forms of memory. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p217"> Semantic memory augmentation (semantic memory) differentiates between various types of memories (semantic, episodic, procedural). It implements them through semantic augmentation, enhancing agents’ ability to recall and use information relevantly specific to the nature of the memories. </li> &#13;
