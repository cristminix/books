   <p>Behavior trees are a long-established pattern used to control robotics and AI in games. Rodney A. Brooks first introduced the concept in his “A Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot” paper in 1986. This laid the groundwork for a pattern that expanded on using the tree and node structure we have today.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> &#13;
   <p>If you’ve ever played a computer game with nonplayer characters (NPCs) or interacted with advanced robotic systems, you’ve witnessed behavior trees at work. Figure 6.1 shows a simple behavior tree. The tree represents all the primary nodes: selector or fallback nodes, sequence nodes, action nodes, and condition nodes.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>The primary nodes in table 6.1 can provide enough functionality to handle numerous use cases. However, understanding behavior trees initially can be daunting. You won’t appreciate their underlying complexity until you start using them. Before we build some simple trees, we want to look at execution in more detail in the next section.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>Understanding how behavior trees execute is crucial to designing and implementing behavior trees. Unlike most concepts in computer science, behavior trees operate in terms of success and failure. When a node in a behavior tree executes, it will return either success or failure; this even applies to conditions and selector nodes.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19"> &#13;
   <p>Behavior trees execute from top to bottom and left to right. Figure 6.2 shows the process and what happens if a node fails or succeeds. In the example, the AI the tree controls has an apple but no pear. In the first sequence node, a condition checks if the AI has an apple. Because the AI doesn’t have an apple, it aborts the sequence and falls back to the selector. The selector then selects its next child node, another sequence, that checks if the AI has a pear, and because it does, the AI eats the apple.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p21"> &#13;
   <p>Behavior trees provide control over how an AI system will execute at a macro or micro level. Regarding robotics, behavior trees will typically be designed to operate at the micro level, where each action or condition is a small event, such as detecting the apple. Conversely, behavior trees can also control more macro systems, such as NPCs in games, where each action may be a combination of events, like attacking the player.</p> &#13;

   <p>For agentic systems, behavior trees support controlling an agent or assistant at your chosen level. We’ll explore controlling agents at the task and, in later chapters, the planning levels. After all, with the power of LLMs, agents can construct their own behavior tree.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23"> &#13;

   <p>In later chapters of this book, we’ll investigate some of the patterns discussed in table 6.2. Overall, several patterns can be enhanced or incorporated using behavior trees as the base. While other patterns, such as FSMs, may be helpful for small experiments, they lack the scalability of behavior trees.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p29"> &#13;
   <p>Behavior trees can provide several benefits as an AI control system, including scalability. The following list highlights other notable benefits of using behavior trees:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p30"> <em>Modularity and reusability</em>—Behavior trees promote a modular approach to designing behaviors, allowing developers to create reusable components. Nodes in a behavior tree can be easily reused across different parts of the tree or even in different projects, enhancing maintainability and reducing development time. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p31"> <em>Scalability</em>—As systems grow in complexity, behavior trees handle the addition of new behaviors more gracefully than other methods, such as FSMs. Behavior trees allow for the hierarchical organization of tasks, making it easier to manage and understand large behavior sets. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p32"> <em>Flexibility and extensibility</em>—Behavior trees offer a flexible framework where new nodes (actions, conditions, decorators) can be added without drastically altering the existing structure. This extensibility makes it straightforward to introduce new behaviors or modify existing ones to adapt to new requirements. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p33"> <em>Debugging and visualization</em>—Behavior trees provide a clear and intuitive visual representation of behaviors, which is beneficial for debugging and understanding the decision-making process. Tools that support behavior trees often include graphical editors that allow developers to visualize and debug the tree structure, making it easier to identify and fix problems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p34"> <em>Decoupling of decision logic</em>—Behavior trees separate the decision-making and execution logic, promoting a clear distinction between high-level strategy and low-level actions. This decoupling simplifies the design and allows for more straightforward modifications and testing of specific behavior parts without affecting the entire system. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p35"> &#13;
   <p>Having made a strong case for behavior trees, we should now consider how to implement them in code. In the next section, we look at how to build a simple behavior tree, using Python code.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p43"> &#13;
   <p>For the development of this book, several GitHub projects were created to address various aspects of building agents and assistants. One such project, the GPT Assistants Playground, is built using Gradio for the interface that mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground but with several extras added.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p44"> &#13;
   <p>The Playground project was developed as both a teaching and demonstration aid. Inside the project, the Python code uses the OpenAI Assistants API to create a chat interface and an agentic system to build and power assistants. There is also a comprehensive collection of actions assistants you can use, and you can easily add your own actions.</p> &#13;

   <p>You can run the application from the terminal or using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), with the latter giving you more control. Before running the application, you need to set your OpenAI API key through the command line or by creating an <code>.env</code> file, as we’ve done a few times already. Listing 6.3 shows an example of setting the environment variable on Linux/Mac or the Git Bash shell (Windows recommended) and running the application.</p> &#13;

   <div class="readable-text" id="p54"> &#13;
    <p>OpenAI defines a GPT as the assistant you can run and use within the ChatGPT interface. An assistant can only be consumed through the API and requires custom code in most cases. When you run an assistant, you’re charged according to the model token usage and any special tools, including the Code Interpreter and files, whereas a GPT runs within ChatGPT and is covered by account costs.</p> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
   <div class="readable-text" id="p55"> &#13;
    <p>The reason for creating a local version of the Playground was an exercise to demonstrate the code structure but also provide additional features listed here:</p> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
   <ul> &#13;
    <li class="readable-text" id="p56"> <em>Actions (custom actions)</em>—Creating your own actions allows you to add any functionality you want to an assistant. As we’ll see, the Playground makes it very easy to create your own actions quickly. </li> &#13;
    <li class="readable-text" id="p57"> <em>Code runner</em>—The API does come with a Code Interpreter, but it’s relatively expensive ($.03 per run), doesn’t allow you to install your modules, can’t run code interactively, and runs slowly. The Playground will enable you to run Python code locally in an isolated virtual environment. While not as secure as pushing code out to Docker images, it does execute code windowed and out of process better than other platforms. </li> &#13;
    <li class="readable-text" id="p58"> <em>Transparency and logging</em>—The Playground provides for comprehensive capturing of logs and will even show how the assistant uses internal and external tools/actions. This can be an excellent way to see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes. </li> &#13;
   </ul> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p59"> &#13;
   <p>Each of these features is covered in more detail over the next few sections. We’ll start with a look at using and consuming actions in the next section.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p61"> &#13;
   <p>Actions and tools are the building blocks that empower agents and assistants. Without access to tools, agents are functionless chatbots. The OpenAI platform is a leader in establishing many of the patterns for tools, as we saw in chapter 3.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p62"> &#13;
   <p>The Playground provides several custom actions that can be attached to assistants through the interface. In this next exercise, we’ll build a simple assistant and attach a couple of custom actions to see what is possible.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p63"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 6.4 shows the expanded Actions accordion, which displays many available custom actions. Run the Playground from the terminal or debugger, and create a new assistant. Then, select the actions shown in the figure. After you’re done selecting the actions, scroll to the bottom, and click Add Assistant to add the assistant. Assistants need to be created before they can be used.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66"> &#13;
   <p>Adding your custom actions is as simple as adding code to a file and dropping it in the right folder.

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p71"> &#13;
   <p>To run several of the examples in this chapter, you’ll need to install the assistants database. Fortunately, this can be easily done through the interface and just by asking agents. The upcoming instructions detail the process for installing the assistants and are taken directly from the GPT Assistants Playground README. You can install several of the demo assistants located in the <code>assistants.db</code> SQLite database:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p72"> Create a new assistant, or use an existing assistant. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p73"> Give the assistant the <code>create_manager_assistant</code> action (found under the Actions section). </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p74"> Ask the assistant to create the manager assistant (i.e., “please create the manager assistant”), and be sure to name the assistant “Manager Assistant.” </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p75"> Refresh your browser to reload the assistants selector. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p76"> Select the new Manager Assistant. This assistant has the instructions and actions that will allow it to install assistants from the <code>assistants.db</code> database. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p77"> Talk to the Manager Assistant to give you a list of assistants to install, or just ask the Manager Assistant to install all available assistants. </li> &#13;

   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_81"><span class="num-string">6.2.4</span> Getting an assistant to run code locally</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p79"> &#13;
   <p>Getting agents and assistants to generate and run executable code has a lot of power. Unlike the Code Interpreter, running code locally provides numerous opportunities to iterate and tune quickly. We saw this earlier with AutoGen, where the agents could keep running the code until it worked as expected.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p80"> &#13;
   <p>In the Playground, it’s a simple matter to select the custom action <code>run_code</code>, as shown in figure 6.5. You’ll also want to choose the <code>run_shell_command</code> action because it allows the assistant to <code>pip install</code> any required modules.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p82"> &#13;
   <p>You can now ask an assistant to generate and run the code to be sure it works on your behalf. Try this out by adding the custom actions and asking the assistant to generate and run code, as shown in figure 6.6. If the code doesn’t work as expected, tell the assistant what problems you encountered.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p84"> &#13;
   <p>Again, the Python code running in the Playground creates a new virtual environment in a project subfolder. This system works well if you’re not running any operating system–level code or low-level code. If you need something more robust, a good option is AutoGen, which uses Docker containers to run isolated code.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p85"> &#13;
   <p>Adding actions to run code or other tasks can make assistants feel like a black box. Fortunately, the OpenAI Assistants API allows you to consume events and see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes. In the next section, we’ll see what this looks like.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p86"> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p87"> &#13;
   <p>OpenAI added a feature into the Assistants API that allows you to listen to events and actions chained through tool/action use. This feature has been integrated into the Playground, capturing action and tool use when an assistant calls another assistant. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p88"> &#13;
   <p>We can try this by asking an assistant to use a tool and then open the log. A great example of how you can do this is by giving an assistant the Code Interpreter tool and then asking it to plot an equation. Figure 6.7 shows an example of this exercise.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p89">  &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p90"> &#13;
   <p>Usually, when the Assistant Code Interpreter tool is enabled, you don’t see any code generation or execution. This feature allows you to see all tools and actions used by the assistant as they happen. Not only is it an excellent tool for diagnostics, but it also provides additional insights into the functions of LLMs.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p91"> &#13;
   <p>We haven’t reviewed the code to do all this because it’s extensive and will likely undergo several changes. That being said, if you plan on working with the Assistants API, this project is a good place to start. With the Playground introduced, we can continue our journey into ABTs in the next section.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p93"> &#13;
   <p>Agentic behavior trees (ABTs) implement behavior trees on assistant and agent systems. The key difference between regular behavior trees and ABTs is that they use prompts to direct actions and conditions. Because prompts may return a high occurrence of random results, we could also name these trees <em>stochastic</em> behavior trees, which do exist. For simplicity, we’ll differentiate behavior trees used to control agents, referring to them as agentic.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p94"> &#13;
   <p>Next, we’ll undertake an exercise to create an ABT. The finished tree will be written in Python but will require the setup and configuration of various assistants. We’ll cover how to manage assistants using the assistants themselves.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p96"> &#13;
   <p>Fortunately, the Playground can help us quickly manage and create the assistants. We’ll first install the Manager Assistant, followed by installing the predefined assistants. let’s get started with installing the Manager Assistant using the following steps:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p97"> Open Playground in your browser, and create a new simple assistant or use an existing assistant. If you need a new assistant, create it and then select it. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p98"> With the assistant selected, open the Actions accordion, and select the <code>create_ manager_assistant</code> action. You don’t need to save; the interface will update the assistant automatically. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p99"> Now, in the chat interface, prompt the assistant with the following: “Please create the manager assistant.” </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p100"> After a few seconds, the assistant will say it’s done. Refresh your browser, and confirm that the Manager Assistant is now available. If, for some reason, the new assistant isn’t shown, try restarting the Gradio app itself. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p101"> &#13;
   <p>The Manager Assistant is like an admin that has access to everything. When engaging the Manager Assistant, be sure to be specific about your requests. With the Manager Assistant active, you can now install new assistants used in the book using the following steps:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p102"> Select the Manager Assistant. If you’ve modified the Manager Assistant, you can delete it and reinstall it anytime. Although it’s possible to have multiple Manager Assistants, it’s not recommended. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p103"> Ask the Manager Assistant what assistants can be installed by typing the following in the chat interface: </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p104"> &#13;
   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;

   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p107"> &#13;
   <p>You can manage and install any available assistants using the Playground. You can also ask the Manager Assistant to save the definitions of all your assistants as JSON:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p108"> &#13;
   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;
    <pre class="code-area">Please save all the assistants as JSON to a file called assistants.json.</pre>  &#13;
   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p109"> &#13;
   <p>The Manager Assistant can access all actions, which should be considered unique and used sparingly. When crafting assistants, it’s best to keep them goal specific and limit the actions to just what they need. This not only avoids giving the AI too many decisions but also avoids accidents or mistakes caused by hallucinations.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p110"> &#13;
   <p>As we go through the remaining exercises in this chapter, you’ll likely need to install the required assistants. Alternatively, you can ask the Manager Assistant to install all available assistants. Either way, we look at creating an ABT with assistants in the next section.</p> &#13;

   <p>For this coding challenge, we’re going a little further and looking at Python coding challenges from the Edabit site (<a href="https://edabit.com">https://edabit.com</a>), which range in complexity from beginner to expert. We’ll stick with the expert code challenges because GPT-4o and other models are excellent coders. Look at the challenge in the next listing, and think about how you would solve it.</p> &#13;

&#13;
    You will be given a matrix representing a field g &#13;
and two numbers x, y coordinate.&#13;
&#13;
    There are three types of possible characters in the matrix:&#13;
&#13;
        x representing a rock.&#13;
        o representing a dirt space.&#13;
        + representing a grassed space.&#13;
&#13;
    You have to simulate grass growing from the position (x, y). &#13;
    Grass can grow in all four directions (up, left, right, down). &#13;
    Grass can only grow on dirt spaces and can't go past rocks.&#13;
&#13;
    Return the simulated matrix.&#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p116"> The challenge should be testable with quantifiable assertions (pass/fail). </li> &#13;

   <p>Figure 6.8 shows the makeup of a straightforward behavior tree that will be used to solve various programming challenges. You’ll notice that this ABT uses a different assistant for the actions and conditions. For the first step, the Python coding assistant (called the Hacker) generates a solution that is then reviewed by the coding challenge Judge (called the Judge), which produces a refined solution that is verified by a different Python coding assistant (called the Verifier).<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Figure 6.8 also shows how each agent converses on which thread. Assistants use message threads, similar to a Slack or Discord channel, where all assistants conversing on a thread will see all messages. For this ABT, we keep one main conversation thread for the Hacker and Judge to share messages, while the Verifier works on a separate message thread. Keeping the Verifier on its own thread isolates it from the noise of the solution-solving efforts.</p> &#13;

   <p>This example’s work is done mainly with the Playground code, using the helper functions <code>create_assistant_condition</code> and <code>create_assistant_action_on_thread</code>. This code uses a couple of classes to integrate the <code>py_trees</code> behavior tree code and the OpenAI Assistants code wrapped in the Playground.

  <div class="readable-text" id="p131"> &#13;
   <p>We already looked at conversational multi-agent systems in chapter 4 when we looked at AutoGen. The ABT can work using a combination of conversations (over threads) and other methods, such as file sharing. Having your assistants/agents pass files around helps reduce the number of noisy and repetitive thoughts/conversations. In contrast, conversational systems benefit from potential emergent behaviors. So, using both can help evolve better control and solutions.</p> &#13;

   <p>Figure 6.9 shows the ABT assembled with each of the different assistants. In this exercise, we use a sequence node for the root, and each assistant performs a different action. Also, to keep things simple, each assistant interaction will always occur in a new thread. This isolates each assistant’s interaction into a concise conversation that’s easier to debug if something goes wrong.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>We’ve now seen a couple of ABTs in action and understand the nuances of using silos or conversations. The following section will teach you some techniques for building your own ABTs.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p162"> &#13;
   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_90"><span class="num-string">6.5</span> Building ABTs with back chaining</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p163"> &#13;
   <p>Back chaining is a method derived from logic and reasoning used to help build behavior trees by working backward from the goal. This section will use the back chaining process to construct an ABT that works to achieve the goal. The following list provides a description of the process in more detail:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p164"> <em>Identify goal behavior</em>. Start with the behavior you want the agent to perform. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p165"> <em>Determine the required actions</em>. Identify the actions that lead to the goal behavior. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p166"> <em>Identify the conditions</em>. Determine the conditions that must be met for each action to succeed. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p167"> <em>Determine the mode of communication</em>. Determine how the assistants will pass on information. Will the assistants be siloed or converse over threads, or is a combination of patterns better? </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p168"> <em>Construct the tree.</em> Start by building the behavior tree from the goal behavior, adding nodes for actions and conditions recursively until all necessary conditions are linked to known states or facts. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p169"> &#13;
   <p>Behavior trees typically use a pattern called the <em>blackboard</em> to communicate across nodes. Blackboards, like those in <code>py_trees</code>, use a key/value store to save information and make it accessible across nodes. It also provides for several controls, such as limiting access to specific nodes. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p170"> &#13;
   <p>We deferred to using files for communication because of their simplicity and transparency. At some point, agentic systems are expected to consume much more information and in different formats than those designed for blackboards. Blackboards must either become more sophisticated or be integrated with file storage solutions.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p171"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s build an ABT using back chaining. We could tackle a variety of goals, but one interesting and perhaps meta goal is to build an ABT that helps build assistants. So let’s first present our goal as a statement “Create an assistant that can help me do {task}”:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p172"> <em>Required actions</em>: (working backwards) &#13;
    <ul> &#13;
     <li> Create an assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> Verify the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> Test the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> Name the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> Give the assistant the relevant instructions. </li> &#13;
    </ul></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p173"> <em>Identified condition: </em> &#13;
    <ul> &#13;
     <li> Verify the assistant. </li> &#13;
    </ul></li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p174"> <em>Determine communication patterns</em>: To keep things interesting, we’ll run all assistants on the same message thread. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p175"> <em>Construct the tree</em>: To construct the tree, let’s first reverse the order of actions and mark each of the element’s actions and conditions accordingly: &#13;
    <ul> &#13;
     <li> (action) Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user with a given task. </li> &#13;
     <li> (action) Name the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> (action) Test the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> (condition) Verify the assistant. </li> &#13;
     <li> (action) Create the assistant. </li> &#13;
    </ul></li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p176"> &#13;
   <p>Of course, the simple solution to building the tree now is to ask ChatGPT or an otherwise capable model. The result of asking ChatGPT to make the tree is shown in the next listing. You could also work the tree out independently and perhaps introduce other elements.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p177"> &#13;
   <h5 class="listing-container-h5 browsable-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Listing 6.11</span> ABT for building an assistant</h5> &#13;
   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;

├── Sequence&#13;
│    ├── Action: Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user &#13;

   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p178"> &#13;
   <p>From this point, we can start building the tree by iterating over each action and condition node and determining what instructions the assistant needs. This can also include any tools and custom actions, including ones you may need to develop. On your first pass, keep the instructions generic. Ideally, we want to create as few assistants as necessary.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p179"> &#13;
   <p>After determining the assistant, tools, and actions for each assistant and for which task, you can try to generalize things further. Think about where it may be possible to combine actions and reduce the number of assistants. It’s better to start evaluating with insufficient assistants than with too many. However, be sure to maintain the proper divisions of work as tasks: for example, testing and verification are best done with different assistants.</p> &#13;

  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p214"> Behavior trees are a robust and scalable AI control pattern, first introduced in robotics by Rodney A. Brooks. They are widely used in gaming and robotics for their modularity and reusability. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p215"> The primary nodes in behavior trees are the selector, sequence, condition, action, decorator, and parallel nodes. Selectors are like “or” blocks: sequence executes nodes in sequence, condition tests the state, action does the work, decorator is a wrapper, and parallel nodes allow for dual execution. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p216"> Understanding the execution flow of behavior trees can be critical to designing, building, and operating them to provide control for making clear decision-making paths. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p217"> The advantages of behavior trees include modularity, scalability, flexibility, debugging ease, and decoupling of decision logic, making behavior trees suitable for complex AI systems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p218"> Setting up and running a simple behavior tree in Python requires correctly naming and documenting custom nodes. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p219"> The GPT Assistants Playground project is a Gradio-based interface that mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground with additional features for teaching and demonstrating ABTs. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p220"> The GPT Assistants Playground allows for creating and managing custom actions, which is essential for building versatile assistants. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p221"> ABTs control agents and assistants by using prompts to direct actions and conditions for assistants. ABTs use the power of LLMs to create dynamic and autonomous systems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p222"> Back chaining is a method for constructing behavior trees by working backward from the goal behavior. This process involves identifying required actions, conditions, and communication patterns, and then constructing the tree step by step. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p223"> Agentic systems benefit from siloed and conversation patterns for communicating between entities. ABTs can benefit from combining siloed and conversational assistants to use structured processes and emergent behaviors. </li> &#13;
