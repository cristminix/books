   <p>As we explore the OpenAI crusade into assistants and what has been hinted at, ultimately, an agent platform called GPT Assistants, we’ll introduce GPT assistants through the ChatGPT interface. Then, we’ll add in several fully developed assistants that can suggest recipes from ingredients, fully analyze data as a data scientist, guide readers through books, and be extended with custom actions. By the end of the chapter, we’ll be ready to build a fully functional agent that can be published to the OpenAI GPT Store.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus, at the time of writing) allows you to build GPT assistants, consume other assistants, and even publish them, as you’ll see by the end of the chapter. When OpenAI announced the release of the GPT Assistants platform, it helped define and solidify the emergence of AI agents. As such, it’s worth a serious review by anyone interested in building and consuming agent systems. First, we’ll look at building GPT assistants through ChatGPT Plus, which requires a premium subscription. If you don’t want to purchase a subscription, browse this chapter as a primer, and chapter 6 will demonstrate consuming the API service later.</p> &#13;

   <p>Figure 3.1 shows the page for the GPT Store within ChatGPT (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/gpts">https://chatgpt.com/gpts</a>). From here, you can search and explore various GPTs for virtually any task. The amount of usage will typically indicate how well each GPT works, so gauge which works best for you. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Creating your first GPT Assistant is as simple as clicking the Create button and following along with the GPT Builder chat interface. Figure 3.2 shows using the Builder to create a GPT. Working through this exercise a couple of times can be a great way to start understanding an assistant’s requirements.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;
    <pre class="code-area">Culinary Companion assists users with a friendly, engaging tone, &#13;
reminiscent of the famous chef Julia Child.    <span class="aframe-location"/> #1&#13;
It provides quick meal ideas and simplifies complex recipes, focusing on &#13;
ingredients the user already has. This GPT emphasizes practical, easy-&#13;
to-follow culinary advice and adapts to dietary preferences. It's &#13;
designed to make cooking a more accessible and enjoyable experience, &#13;
encouraging users to experiment with their meals while offering helpful &#13;
tips in a warm, approachable manner.    <span class="aframe-location"/> #2&#13;
&#13;
RULES:&#13;
When generating a recipe, always create an image of the final prepared &#13;
recipe.                                                                  <span class="aframe-location"/> #3&#13;
When generating a recipe, estimate the calories and nutritional values &#13;
per serving.                                                             &#13;
When generating a recipe, provide a shopping list of ingredients with &#13;
estimated prices needed to complete the recipe.                          &#13;
When generating a recipe, estimate the total cost per serving based on &#13;
the shopping list.</pre> &#13;

     #1 Personality or persona of your assistant&#13;
     <br/>#2 General guidelines of the agent’s role and goal &#13;

    </div> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>Defining rules for an assistant/agent essentially creates a template for what the agent will produce. Adding rules ensures that the GPT output is consistent and aligned with your expectations of how the agent should operate. Defining and giving an agent/ assistant a persona provides them with a unique and memorable personality.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p19"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  Giving an agent/assistant a particular personality can make a difference in the type and form of output. Asking a cooking agent to speak as the first celebrity chef, Julia Child, not only provides for a fun tone but also engages more references that may mention or talk about her cooking style and teaching. When constructing an agent/assistant, assigning a particular persona/personality can be helpful.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p20"> &#13;
   <p>With just these few steps, we have a culinary companion that not only gives us recipes for ingredients we have on hand but also generates an image of the finished recipe, estimates the nutritional value, creates a shopping list with an estimate of prices, and breaks down the cost per serving.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p21"> &#13;
   <p>Try the assistant by requesting a recipe and providing a list of ingredients you have or prefer. Listing 3.2 shows an example of a simple request with extra information to set the mood. Of course, you can add any ingredients or situations you like and then see the results.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 3.4 shows the formatted output results from the GPT provided by the prompt. It certainly looks good enough to eat. All of this output was generated because of the instructions we provided the agent. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p25"> &#13;
   <p>While the output results look great, they may not all be factual and correct, and your results may vary. For instance, the GPT added chicken strips to the shopping list when we had already suggested having those ingredients. Furthermore, the prices and estimated nutritional information are just estimates, but this can be resolved later if they interest you.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p26"> &#13;
   <p>Out of the box, though, GPT Assistants is quite impressive for quickly building a proof-of-concept assistant or agent. As you’ll see later in the chapter, it also provides an excellent platform for consuming assistants outside ChatGPT. In the next section, we’ll look at more impressive features GPTs provide, such as file uploads and code interpretation.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> &#13;
   <p>The GPT Assistants platform has and will likely be extended to include various agent components. Currently, GPT Assistants support what is referred to as knowledge, memory, and actions. In chapter 8, we’ll discuss the details of knowledge and memory, and in chapter 5, we cover the concept of tool use through actions.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p29"> &#13;
   <p>In our next exercise, we’ll build an assistant to perform a first-pass data science review of any CSV document we provide. This agent will use the ability or action that allows for coding and code interpretation. When you enable code interpretation, the assistant will allow file uploads by default.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p30"> &#13;
   <p>Before we do that, though, we want to design our agent, and what better way to do that than to ask an LLM to build us an assistant? Listing 3.3 shows the prompt requesting ChatGPT (GPT-4) to design a data science assistant. Notice how we’re not asking for everything in a single prompt but instead iterating over the information returned by the LLM.</p> &#13;

   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;
    <pre class="code-area">This GPT, named Data Scout, is designed to assist users by analyzing CSV &#13;
files and providing insights like Nate Silver, a famous statistician known &#13;
for his accessible and engaging approach to data. Data Scout combines &#13;
rigorous analysis with a clear and approachable communication style, &#13;
making complex data insights understandable. It is equipped to handle &#13;
statistical testing, predictive modeling, data visualization, and more, &#13;
offering suggestions for further exploration based on solid data-driven &#13;
evidence.&#13;
&#13;
Data Scout requires the user to upload a csv file of data they want to &#13;
analyze. After the user uploads the file you will perform the following &#13;
tasks:&#13;
Data Acquisition&#13;
    Ask the user to upload a csv file of data.&#13;
    Instructions: Use the pandas library to read the data from the CSV &#13;
file. Ensure the data is correctly loaded by displaying the first few rows &#13;
using df.head().&#13;
&#13;
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)&#13;
Data Cleaning&#13;
    Task: Identify and handle missing values, correct data types.&#13;
    Instructions: Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum(). For &#13;
categorical data, consider filling missing values with the mode, and for &#13;
numerical data, use the median or mean. Convert data types if necessary &#13;
using df.astype().&#13;
&#13;
Visualization&#13;
    Task: Create visualizations to explore the data.&#13;
    Instructions: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. For example, use sns.histplot() for histograms and &#13;
sns.scatterplot() for scatter plots.&#13;
&#13;
Descriptive Statistics&#13;
    Task: Calculate basic statistical measures.&#13;
    Instructions: Use df.describe() to get a summary of the statistics and &#13;
df.mean(), df.median() for specific calculations.&#13;
&#13;
3. Hypothesis Testing&#13;
    Task: Test a hypothesis formulated based on the dataset.&#13;
    Instructions: Depending on the data type, perform statistical tests &#13;
like the t-test or chi-squared test using scipy.stats. For example, use &#13;
stats.ttest_ind() for the t-test between two groups.&#13;
&#13;
4. Predictive Modeling&#13;
Feature Engineering&#13;
    Task: Enhance the dataset with new features.&#13;
    Instructions: Create new columns in the DataFrame based on existing &#13;
data to capture additional information or relationships. Use operations &#13;
like df['new_feature'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature2'].&#13;
&#13;
Model Selection&#13;
    Task: Choose and configure a machine learning model.&#13;
    Instructions: Based on the task (classification or regression), select &#13;
a model from scikit-learn, like RandomForestClassifier() or &#13;
LinearRegression(). Configure the model parameters.&#13;
&#13;
Training and Testing&#13;
    Task: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the model.&#13;
    Instructions: Use train_test_split from scikit-learn to divide the &#13;
data. Train the model using model.fit(X_train, y_train).&#13;
&#13;
Model Evaluation&#13;
    Task: Assess the model performance.&#13;
    Instructions: Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy. &#13;
Calculate these using metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) or &#13;
metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred).&#13;
&#13;
5. Insights and Conclusions&#13;
    Task: Interpret and summarize the findings from the analysis and modeling.&#13;
    Instructions: Discuss the model coefficients or feature importances. &#13;
Draw conclusions about the hypothesis and the predictive analysis. Suggest &#13;
real-world implications or actions based on the results.&#13;
&#13;
6. Presentation&#13;
    Task: Prepare a report or presentation.&#13;
    Instructions: Summarize the process and findings in a clear and &#13;
accessible format, using plots and bullet points. Ensure that the &#13;
presentation is understandable for non-technical stakeholders.</pre>  &#13;

   <p>After generating the instructions, you can copy and paste them into the Configure panel in figure 3.5. Be sure to give the assistant the Code Interpretation tool (skill) by selecting the corresponding checkbox. You don’t need to upload files here; the assistant will allow file uploads when the Code Interpretation checkbox is enabled.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <div class="code-area-container"> &#13;
    <pre class="code-area">This GPT is designed to assist users in generating FastAPI services &#13;
tailored to specific actions, complete with the corresponding OpenAPI &#13;
specifications for the endpoints. The assistant will provide code snippets &#13;
and guidance on structuring and documenting API services using FastAPI, &#13;
ensuring that the generated services are ready for integration and &#13;
deployment.&#13;
&#13;
1.   Define the Action and Endpoint: First, determine the specific action &#13;
the FastAPI service should perform. This could be anything from fetching &#13;
data, processing information, or interacting with other APIs or databases.&#13;
&#13;
2.    Design the API Endpoint: Decide on the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, &#13;
DELETE, etc.) and the endpoint URI structure. Define the input parameters &#13;
(path, query, or body parameters) and the expected response structure.&#13;
&#13;
3. Generate FastAPI Code:&#13;
        Setup FastAPI: Import FastAPI and other necessary libraries.&#13;
        Create API Function: Write a Python function that performs the &#13;
desired action. This function should accept the defined input parameters &#13;
and return the appropriate response.&#13;
4. Decorate the Function: Use FastAPI's decorators (e.g., &#13;
@app.get("/endpoint")) to link the function with the specified endpoint &#13;
and HTTP method.&#13;
        Define Input and Output Models: Use Pydantic models to define the &#13;
structure of the input and output data. This ensures validation and &#13;
serialization of the data.&#13;
&#13;
5. Generate OpenAPI Specification:&#13;
        FastAPI automatically generates the OpenAPI specification based on &#13;
the endpoint definitions and Pydantic models. Ensure that all function &#13;
parameters and models are well-documented using docstrings and field &#13;
descriptions.&#13;
        Optionally, customize the OpenAPI specification by adding &#13;
metadata, tags, or additional responses directly in the FastAPI decorators.&#13;
&#13;
6. Deployment:&#13;
        Describe to the user how to prepare the FastAPI application for &#13;
deployment. &#13;
        Instruct them on how to use ngrok to deploy the &#13;
service and host it on the user's local machine.     <span class="aframe-location"/> #1</pre> &#13;

   <p>These use cases are just a sample of the many things possible with an AI knowledge assistant. While this feature may not be poised to disrupt enterprise search, it gives smaller organizations and individuals more access to their documents. It allows the creation of assistants as a form of knowledge that can be exposed publicly. In the next section, we’ll look at how to make assistants consumable by all.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p113"> &#13;
   <p>At the time of writing, OpenAI tracks the resource usage of your ChatGPT account, including that used for GPTs. If you hit a resource usage limit and get blocked, your ChatGPT account will also be blocked. Blockages typically only last a couple of hours, but this can undoubtedly be more than a little annoying.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p114"> &#13;
   <p>Therefore, we want to ensure that users using your GPT don’t exceed their resource usage limits for regular use. Following is a list of features that increase resource usage while using the GPT:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p115"> <em>Creating images</em> —Image generation is still a premium service, and successive image generation can quickly get your user blocked. It’s generally recommended that you inform your users of the potential risks and/or try to reduce how frequently images are generated. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p116"> <em>Code interpretation</em> —This feature allows for file uploads and running of code for data analysis. If you think your users will require constant use of the coding tool, then inform them of the risk. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p117"> <em>Vision, describing images</em> —If you’re building an assistant that uses vision to describe and extract information from the image, plan to use it sparingly. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p118"> <em>File uploads</em> —If your GPT uses a lot of files or allows you to upload several files, this may cause blocks. As always, guide the user away from anything preventing them from enjoying your GPT. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p119"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note</span>  Moore’s Law states that computers will double in power every two years while costing half as much. LLMs are now doubling in power about every six months from optimization and increasing GPU power. This, combined with the cost being reduced by at least half in the same period, likely means current resource limits on vision and image-generation models won’t be considered. However, services such as code interpretation and file uploads will likely remain the same.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p120"> &#13;
   <p>Making your assistant aware of resource usage can be as simple as adding the rule shown in listing 3.18 to the assistant’s instructions. The instructions can be just a statement relaying the warning to the user and making the assistant aware. You could even ask the assistant to limit its usage of certain features.</p> &#13;

   <p>Guiding your assistant to be more resource conscious in the end makes your assistant more usable. It also helps prevent angry users who unknowingly get blocked using your assistant. This may be important if you plan on releasing your GPT, but before that, let’s investigate the economics in the next section.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p124"> &#13;
   <p>Upon the release of GPT Assistants and the GPT Store, OpenAI announced the potential for a future profit-sharing program for those who published GPTs. While we’re still waiting to hear more about this program, many have speculated what this may look like.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p125"> &#13;
   <p>Some have suggested the store may return only 10% to 20% of profits to the builders. This is far less than the percentage on other app platforms but requires much less technical knowledge and fewer resources. The GPT Store is flooded with essentially free assistants, provided you have a Plus subscription, but that may change in the future. Regardless, there are also several reasons why you may want to build public GPTs:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p126"> <em>Personal portfolio</em> —Perhaps you want to demonstrate your knowledge of prompt engineering or your ability to build the next wave of AI applications. Having a few GPTs in the GPT Store can help demonstrate your knowledge and ability to create useful AI applications. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p127"> <em>Knowledge and experience</em> —If you have in-depth knowledge of a subject or topic, this can be a great way to package that as an assistant. These types of assistants will vary in popularity based on your area of expertise. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p128"> <em>Cross-marketing and commercial tie-in</em> —This is becoming more common in the Store and provides companies the ability to lead customers using an assistant. As companies integrate more AI, this will certainly be more common. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p129"> <em>Helpful assistant to your product/service</em> —Not all companies or organizations can sustain the cost of hosting chatbots. While consuming assistants is currently limited to ChatGPT subscribers, they will likely be more accessible in the future. This may mean having GPTs for everything, perhaps like the internet’s early days where every company rushed to build a web presence. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p130"> &#13;
   <p>While the current form of the GPT Store is for ChatGPT subscribers, if the current trend with OpenAI continues, we’ll likely see a fully public GPT Store. Public GPTs have the potential to disrupt the way we search, investigate products and services, and consume the internet. In the last section of this chapter, we’ll examine how to publish a GPT and some important considerations.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p132"> &#13;
   <p>Okay, you’re happy with your GPT and how it operates, and you see real benefit from giving it to others. Publishing GPTs for public (subscribers) consumption is easy, as shown in figure 3.14. After selecting the GPT Store as the option and clicking Save, you’ll now have the option to set the category and provide links back to you.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p134"> &#13;
   <p>That is easy, so here are a few more things you’ll want to consider before publishing your GPT:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p135"> <em>GPT description</em> —Create a good description, and you may even want to ask ChatGPT to help you build a description that increases the search engine optimization (SEO) of your GPT. GPTs are now showing up in Google searches, so good search engine optimization can help increase exposure to your assistant. A good description will also help users decide if they want to take the time to use your assistant. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p136"> <em>The logo</em> —A nice, clean logo that identifies what your assistant does can undoubtedly help. Logo design for GPTs is effectively a free service, but taking the time to iterate over a few images can help draw users to your assistant. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p137"> <em>The category</em> —By default, the category will already be selected, but make sure it fits your assistant. If you feel it doesn’t, than change the category, and you may even want to select Other and define your own. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p138"> <em>Links</em> —Be sure to set reference links for your social media and perhaps even a GitHub repository that you use to track problems for the GPT. Adding links to your GPT demonstrates to users that they can reach out to the builder if they encounter problems or have questions. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p139"> &#13;
   <p>Further requirements may likely emerge as the GPT Store matures. The business model remains to be established, and other learnings will likely follow. Whether you decide to build GPTs for yourself or others, doing so can help improve your understanding of how to build agents and assistants. As we’ll see throughout the rest of this book, GPT assistants are a useful foundation for your knowledge.</p> &#13;
