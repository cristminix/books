   <p>After we explored some basic concepts about agents and looked at using actions with tools to build prompts and personas using frameworks such as the Semantic Kernel (SK), we took the first steps toward building a foundation for this book. That foundation is called Nexus, an agent platform designed to be simple to learn, easy to explore, and powerful enough to build your agent systems. </p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_93"><span class="num-string">7.1</span> Introducing Nexus, not just another agent platform</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>There are more than 100 AI platforms and toolkits for consuming and developing large language model (LLM) applications, ranging from toolkits such as SK or LangChain to complete platforms such as AutoGen and CrewAI. This makes it difficult to decide which platform is well suited to building your own AI agents.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p10"> &#13;
   <p>Nexus is an open source platform developed with this book to teach the core concepts of building full-featured AI agents. In this chapter, we’ll examine how Nexus is built and introduce two primary agent components: profiles/personas and actions/tools.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 7.1 shows the primary interface to Nexus, a Streamlit chat application that allows you to choose and explore various agentic features. The interface is similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, and other commercial LLM applications.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p13"> &#13;
   <p>In addition to the standard features of an LLM chat application, Nexus allows the user to configure an agent to use a specific API/model, the persona, and possible actions. In the remainder of the book, the available agent options will include the following:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p14"> <em>Personas/profiles</em>—The primary persona and profile the agent will use. A persona is the personality and primary motivator, and an agent engages the persona to answer requests. We’ll look in this chapter at how personas/profiles can be developed and consumed. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p15"> <em>Actions/tools</em>—Represents the actions an agent can take using tools, whether they’re semantic/prompt or native/code functions. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to build both semantic and native functions within Nexus. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p16"> <em>Knowledge/memory —</em>Represents additional information an agent may have access to. At the same time, agent memory can represent various aspects, from short-term to semantic memory. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p17"> <em>Planning/feedback —</em>Represents how the agent plans and receives feedback on the plans or the execution of plans. Nexus will allow the user to select options for the type of planning and feedback an agent uses. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>As we progress through this book, Nexus will be added to support new agent features. However, simultaneously, the intent will be to keep things relatively simple to teach many of these essential core concepts. In the next section, we’ll look at how to quickly use Nexus before going under the hood to explore features in detail.</p> &#13;

   <p>Begin by opening Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the <code>chapter_07</code> source folder. If you’ve completed the previous exercise, you should already be ready. As always, if you need assistance setting up your environment and tools, refer to appendix B.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p39"> &#13;
   <p>We’ll start by opening the <code>chatgpt_clone_response.py</code> file in VS Code. The top section of the code is shown in listing 7.3. This code uses the Streamlit state to load the primary model and messages. Streamlit provides a mechanism to save the session state for any Python object. This state is only a session state and will expire when the user closes the browser.</p> &#13;

   <p>The Streamlit app itself is stateless. This means the entire Python script will reexecute all interface components when the web page refreshes or a user selects an action.

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p42"> &#13;
   <p>UI controls and components are added by using the <code>st.</code> prefix and then the element name. Streamlit supports several standard UI controls and supports images, video, sound, and, of course, chat.</p> &#13;

   <p>Scrolling down further will yield listing 7.4, which has a slightly more complex layout of the components. The main <code>if</code> statement controls the running of the remaining code.

   <p>We can easily define a new agent profile by creating a new YAML file in the <code>nexus_ profiles</code> folder. Listing 7.7 shows an example of a new profile with a slightly updated persona. To follow along, be sure to have VS Code opened to the <code>chapter_07</code> source code folder and install Nexus in developer mode (see listing 7.7).

   <p>The agent engine also needs to implement that capability to implement functions and other components. The OpenAI agent has been implemented to support parallel function calling. Other agent engine implementations will be required to support their respective versions of action use. Fortunately, the definition of the OpenAI tool is becoming the standard, and many platforms adhere to this standard.</p> &#13;

   <p>Executing the functions follows, as shown in listing 7.14. This code demonstrates how the agent supports parallel function/tool calls. These calls are parallel because the agent executes each one together and in no order. In chapter 11, we’ll look at planners that allow actions to be called in ordered sequences.</p> &#13;
