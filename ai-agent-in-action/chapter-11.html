   <p>Now that we’ve examined how large language models (LLMs) can reason and plan, this chapter takes this concept a step further by employing planning within an agent framework. Planning should be at the core of any agent/assistant platform or toolkit. We’ll start by looking at the basics of planning and how to implement a planner through prompting. Then, we’ll see how planning operates using the OpenAI Assistants platform, which automatically incorporates planning. From there, we’ll build and implement a general planner for LLMs.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> &#13;
   <p>Planning can only go so far, and an often-unrecognized element is feedback. Therefore, in the last sections of the chapter, we explore feedback and implement it within a planner. You must be familiar with the content of chapter 10, so please review it if you need to, and when you’re ready, let’s begin planning.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p10"> &#13;
   <p>Agents and assistants who can’t plan and only follow simple interactions are nothing more than chatbots. As we’ve seen throughout this book, our goal isn’t to build bots but rather to build autonomous thinking agents—agents that can take a goal, work out how to solve it, and then return with the results. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p11"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 11.1 explains the overall planning process that the agent/assistant will undertake. This figure was also presented in chapter 1, but let’s review it now in more detail. At the top of the figure, a user submits a goal. In an agentic system, the agent takes the goal, constructs the plan, executes it, and then returns the results.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Depending on your interaction with platforms such as ChatGPT and GPTs, Claude, and others, you may have already encountered a planning assistant and not even noticed. Planning is becoming ubiquitous and is now built into most commercial platforms to make the model appear more intelligent and capable. Therefore, in the next exercise, we’ll look at an example to set a baseline and differentiate between an LLM that can’t plan and an agent that can.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14"> &#13;
   <p>For the next exercise, we’ll use Nexus to demonstrate how raw LLMs can’t plan independently. If you need assistance installing, setting up, and running Nexus, refer to chapter 7. After you have Nexus installed and ready, we can begin running it with the Gradio interface, using the commands shown next.</p> &#13;

   <p>Gradio is an excellent web interface tool built to demonstrate Python machine learning projects. Figure 11.2 shows the Gradio Nexus interface and the process for creating an agent and using an agent engine (OpenAI, Azure, and Groq) of your choice. You can’t use LM Studio unless the model/server supports tool/action use. Anthropic’s Claude supports internal planning, so for the purposes of this exercise, avoid using this model.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>After creating the agent, we want to give it specific actions (tools) to undertake or complete a goal. Generally, providing only the actions an agent needs to complete its goal is best for a few reasons:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p19"> More actions can confuse an agent into deciding which to use or even how to solve a goal. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p20"> APIs have limits on the number of tools that can be submitted; at the time of writing, hitting this limit is relatively easy. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p21"> Agents may use your actions in ways you didn’t intend unless that’s your goal. Be warned, however, that actions can have consequences. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p22"> Safety and security need to be considered. LLMs aren’t going to take over the world, but they make mistakes and quickly get off track. Remember, these agents will operate independently and may perform any action. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">WARNING </span> While writing this book and working with and building agents over many hours, I have encountered several instances of agents going rogue with actions, from downloading files to writing and executing code when not intended, continually iterating from tool to tool, and even deleting files they shouldn’t have. Watching an agent emerge new behaviors using actions can be fun, but things can quickly go astray.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p24"> &#13;
   <p>For this exercise, we’ll define the goal described in the following listing. </p> &#13;

   <p>After you choose the actions and planner, enter the goal in listing 11.2. Then click Create New Thread to instantiate a new conversation. Substitute the topic you want to search for in the chat input, and wait for the agent to respond. Here’s an example of the goal filled with the topic, but again, use any topic you like:</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p34"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 11.4 shows the results of submitting the goal to the plain agent. We see the agent executed the tool/action to search for the topic but couldn’t execute any steps beyond that. If you recall from our discussion and code example of actions in chapter 5, OpenAI, Groq, and Azure OpenAI all support parallel actions but not sequential or planned actions.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>The LLM can answer reasonably well if you submit a goal with several parallel tasks/actions. However, if the actions are sequential, requiring one step to be dependent on another, it will fail. Remember, parallel actions are standalone actions that can be run alongside others. </p> &#13;

   <p>Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI Assistants support sequential action planning. This means both models can be called with sequential plans, and the model will execute them and return the results. In the next section, we’ll explore sequential planning and then demonstrate it in action.</p> &#13;

   <p>Figure 11.5 shows the difference between executing tasks sequentially (planning) and using iteration. If you’ve used GPTs, assistants, or Claude Sonnet 3.5, you’ve likely already experienced this difference. These advanced tools already incorporate planning by prompt annotations, advanced training, or combining both. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>As LLM and chat services evolve, most models will likely natively support some form of planning and tool use. However, most models, including GPT-4o, only support action/tool use today. </p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p43"> &#13;
   <p>Let’s open the GPT Assistants Playground to demonstrate sequential planning in action. If you need help, refer to the setup guide in chapter 6. We’ll use the same goal but, this time, run it against an assistant (which has built-in planning).</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p44"> &#13;
   <p>After you launch the Playground, create a new assistant, and assign it the <code>search_ wikipedia,</code> <code>get_wikipedia_page</code>, and <code>save_file</code> actions. Figure 11.6 shows the results of entering the goal to the assistant. As you can see, the assistant completed all the tasks behind the scenes and responded with the user’s final requested output, achieving the goal.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of the OpenAI Assistant’s planner, we added another task, summarizing each page, to the goal. The inserted task didn’t have a function/tool, but the assistant was savvy enough to use its ability to summarize the content. You can see the output of what the assistant produced by opening the <code>[root</code> <code>folder]assistants_working_folder/Wikipedia_{topic}.txt</code> file and reviewing the contents. Now that we understand how LLMs function without planners and planning, we can move on to creating our planners in the next section.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p48"> &#13;
   <p>LLM tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel (SK) have many planners using various strategies. However, writing our planner is relatively easy, and Nexus also supports a plugin-style interface allowing you to add other planners from tools such as LangChain and SK, or your derivatives.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p49"> &#13;
   <p>Planners may sound complicated, but they are easily implemented through prompt engineering strategies that incorporate planning and reasoning. In chapter 10, we covered the basics of reasoning and deriving plans, and now we can put those skills to good use.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p50"> &#13;
   <p>Listing 11.3 shows a sequential planner derived from the SK, which is extended to incorporate iteration. Prompt annotation planners like those shown in the listing can be adapted to fit specific needs or be more general like those shown.

   <p>It’s essential to notice a few subtle details about the planning process. Typically, the plan is built in isolation by not adding context history. This is done to focus on the goal because most planning prompts consume many tokens. Executing the functions within the executor is usually done in a local environment and may include calling APIs, executing code, or even running machine learning models.</p> &#13;

   <p>Listing 11.4 shows the code for the <code>create_plan</code> function from the <code>BasicNexusPlanner</code> class; tools such as LangChain and SK use similar patterns. The process loads the agent’s actions as a string. The goal and available functions list are then inserted into the planner prompt template using the <code>PromptTemplateManager</code>, which is just a wrapper for the template-handling code. Template handling is done with simple regex but can also be more sophisticated using tools such as Jinja2, Handlebars, or Mustache.</p> &#13;

   <p>After a few minutes, the agent returns with the saved file, and in some cases, it may provide extra information, such as the next steps and what to do with the output. This is because the agent was given a high-level overview of what it accomplished. Remember, though, that plan execution is done at the local level, and only context, plan, and goal were sent to the LLM.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p63"> &#13;
   <p>This means that plan execution can be completed by any process, not necessarily by the agent. Executing a plan outside the LLM reduces the tokens and tool use the agent needs to perform. This also means that an LLM doesn’t need to support tools usage to use a planner.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p64"> &#13;
   <p>Internally, when a planner is enabled within Nexus, the agent engine tool is bypassed. Instead, the planner completes the action execution, and the agent is only aware of the actions through the passing of the output context. This can be good for models that support tool use but can’t plan. However, a planner may limit functionality for models that support both tool use and planning, such as Claude.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p65"> &#13;
   <p>In general, you’ll want to understand the capabilities of the LLM you’re using. If you’re unsure of those details, then a little trial and error can also work. Ask the agent to complete a multistep goal with and without planning enabled, and then see the results.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p66"> &#13;
   <p>Planning allows agents to complete multiple sequential tasks to achieve more complex goals. The problem with external or prompt planning is that it bypasses the feedback iteration loop, which can help correct problems quickly. Because of this, OpenAI and others are now directly integrating reasoning and planning at the LLM level, as we’ll see in the next section.</p> &#13;

However, after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time &#13;

Arrival in the Past:&#13;
Alex arrives 3 days before the battle begins.&#13;
He spends these 3 days waiting for the battle to start.&#13;
During the Battle:&#13;
The battle starts, and Alex experiences the first 3 days of it.&#13;
At this point, he has spent a total of 6 days in the past (3 days before &#13;
the battle and 3 days during the battle).&#13;
Time Jump Forward:    <span class="aframe-location"/> #1&#13;
After these 6 days, Alex jumps 50 years forward in time.&#13;
He spends 20 days in this future time.&#13;
Return to the Past:&#13;
Alex then returns to the past to witness the end of the battle.&#13;
Since the battle lasts 10 days and he left after day 3 of the battle, &#13;
there are 7 days remaining in the battle.&#13;
However, because he was away for 20 days, which is longer than the &#13;
remaining 7 days of the battle, he must return to a point in time before &#13;
the battle ends to witness its conclusion.&#13;
To see the end of the battle, he returns to the past on the last day of &#13;
the battle.&#13;
Final Days Spent Before the Battle Ends:&#13;
Upon returning, he spends 1 more day in the past to witness the battle's &#13;
end.&#13;
Total Days Spent in the Past Before Seeing the End:&#13;
6 days before jumping forward in time.&#13;
1 day after returning to the past.&#13;
Total: 6 + 1 = 7 days.&#13;

   <p>Because we know the right answer is 27, we know the LLM is wrong, but if we didn’t, we could just as easily assume that the work and reasoning were all correct. Problems like this can happen when we remove feedback in LLM interactions and agentic systems. Feedback can guide the model to correct itself. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p76"> &#13;
   <p>However, what if we didn’t know the correct answer was 27 (26, if you assume he doesn’t spend the day to witness the battle) and assumed the LLM or agent was correct? Well, this is a problem we can rectify with a couple of simple prompts that can engage the LLM in reasoning and planning feedback. However, these techniques are more effective with LLMs or wrappers such as the OpenAI Assistants, which provide reasoning and planning within the model.</p> &#13;

Understanding Time Frames in Time Travel:&#13;
Relative Time Frames: Always consider the time periods relative to the &#13;
original point of reference. In this problem, even though Alex jumps &#13;
forward 50 years, he is still in the past relative to his original &#13;
present time.&#13;
Including All Relevant Periods: &#13;
Ensure that all time periods spent in the past (or future) are included &#13;
in the total calculation, even if they involve moving to different &#13;
points in time.&#13;
Time Continuity: &#13;
Remember that while the traveler moves through time, events in other &#13;
time periods continue to progress unless specified otherwise.&#13;

   <p>This feedback technique will consistently work on models such as o1-preview, but other models may still struggle to answer correctly, even given this feedback. Over time, as models become smarter, this technique will likely generally work on most models. However, this feedback mechanism will likely be essential even as models get progressively brighter. because language is nuanced, and not every problem we challenge LLMs with may have an obvious absolute answer. Take our example problem, for instance. This problem is an excellent example of requiring the problem solver to make assumptions and draw correlations from the question. There are still plenty of areas in science, from geology to behavioral science, where answering the same problem may yield a range of answers. Let’s look next at a few techniques for how the application of reasoning, planning, evaluation, and feedback can be applied to agentic systems.</p> &#13;

We typically associate planning with tool use, and, rightfully, any system using tools will likely want a capable planner. However, not all systems are created equally, so in table 11.1, we’ll review where, when, and how to implement planners.</p> &#13;

   <p>Table 11.1 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how planning may be employed in each application:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p89"> <em>Personal assistant</em>—While this application has been slow to roll out, LLM personal assistants promise to surpass Alexa and Siri in the future. Planning will be essential to these new assistants/agents to coordinate numerous complex tasks and execute tools (actions) in series or parallel. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p90"> <em>Customer service bot</em>—Due to the controlled nature of this environment, it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with customers will have controlled and very specific tools use. This means that these types of assistants will likely not require extensive planning. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p91"> <em>Autonomous agent</em>—As we’ve seen in previous chapters, agents with the ability to plan can complete a series of complex tasks for various goals. Planning will be an essential element of any autonomous agentic system. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p92"> <em>Collaborative workflows</em>—Think of these as agents or assistants that sit alongside coders or writers. While these workflows are still in early development, think of a workflow where agents are automatically tasked with writing and executing test code alongside developers. Planning will be an essential part of executing these complex future workflows. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p93"> <em>Game AI</em>—While applying LLMs to games is still in early stages, it isn’t hard to imagine in-game agents or assistants that can assist or challenge the player. Giving these agents the ability to plan and execute complex workflows could disrupt how and with whom we play games. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p94"> <em>Research</em>—Similar to collaborative workflows, these agents will be responsible for deriving new ideas from existing sources of information. Finding that information will likely be facilitated through extensive tool use, which will benefit from coordination of planning. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p95"> &#13;
   <p>As you can see, planning is an essential part of many LLM applications, whether through coordination of tool use or otherwise. In the next section, we look at the next component of reasoning and how it can be applied to the same application stack.</p> &#13;

   <p>Reasoning, while often strongly associated with planning and task completion, is a component that can also stand by itself. As LLMs mature and get smarter, reasoning is often included within the LLM itself. However, not all applications may benefit from extensive reasoning, as it often introduces a thinking cycle within the LLM response. Table 11.2 describes at a high level how the reasoning component can be integrated with various LLM application types.</p> &#13;

   <p>Table 11.2 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how reasoning may be employed in each application:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p100"> <em>Personal assistant</em>—Depending on the application, the amount of reasoning an agent employs may be limited. Reasoning is a process that requires the LLM to think through a problem, and this often requires longer response times depending on the complexity of the problem and the extent of the prompt. In many situations, responses intended to be closer to real-time reasoning may be disabled or turned down. While this may limit the complexity at which an agent can interact, limited or no reasoning can improve response times and increase user enjoyment. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p101"> <em>Customer service bot</em>—Again, because of the controlled nature of this environment, it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with customers will need to perform complex or any form of reasoning. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p102"> <em>Autonomous agent</em>—While reasoning is a strong component of autonomous agents, we still don’t know how much reasoning is too much. As models such as Strawberry become available for agentic workflows, we can gauge at what point extensive reasoning may not be needed. This will surely be the case for well-defined autonomous agent workflows. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p103"> <em>Collaborative workflows</em>—Again, applying reasoning creates an overhead in the LLM interaction. Extensive reasoning may provide benefits for some workflows, while other well-defined workflows may suffer. This may mean that these types of workflows will benefit from multiple agents—those with reasoning and those without. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p104"> <em>Game AI</em>—Similar to other applications, heavy-reasoning applications may not be appropriate for most game AIs. Games will especially require LLM response times to be quick, and this will surely be the application of reasoning for general tactical agents. Of course, that doesn’t preclude the use of other reasoning agents that may provide more strategic control. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p105"> <em>Research</em>—Reasoning will likely be essential to any complex research task for several reasons. A good example is the application of the Strawberry model, which we’ve already seen in research done in mathematics and the sciences. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p106"> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p111"> <em>Personal assistant</em>—In most cases, an evaluation component will be used to process and guide the performance of agent responses. In systems primarily employing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for document exploration, the evaluation indicates how well the assistant responds to information requests. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p112"> <em>Customer service bot</em>—Evaluating service bots is critical to understanding how well the bot responds to customer requests. In many cases, a strong RAG knowledge element may be an element of the system that will require extensive and ongoing evaluation. Again, with most evaluation components, this element is external to the main working system and is often run as part of monitoring general performance over several metrics. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p113"> <em>Autonomous agent</em>—In most cases, a manual review of agent output will be a primary guide to the success of an autonomous agent. However, in some cases, internal evaluation can help guide the agent when it’s undertaking complex tasks or as a means of improving the final output. Multiple agent systems, such as CrewAI and AutoGen, are examples of autonomous agents that use internal feedback to improve the generated output. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p114"> <em>Collaborative workflows</em>—In most direct cases, manual evaluation is ongoing within these types of workflows. A user will often immediately and in near real time correct the assistant/agent by evaluating the output. Additional agents could be added similarly to autonomous agents for more extensive collaborative workflows. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p115"> <em>Game AI</em>—Evaluation will often be broken down into development evaluation—evaluating how the agent interacts with the game—and in-game evaluation, evaluating how well an agent succeeded at a task. Implementing the later evaluation form is similar to autonomous agents but aims to improve some strategies or execution. Such in-game evaluations would also likely benefit from memory and a means of feedback. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p116"> <em>Research</em>—Evaluation at this level generally occurs as a manual effort after completing the research task. An agent could employ some form of evaluation similar to autonomous agents to improve the generated output, perhaps even contemplating internally how evaluation of the output could be extended or further researched. Because this is currently a new area for agentic development, how well this will be executed remains to be seen. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p117"> &#13;
   <p>Evaluation is an essential element to any agentic or assistant system, especially if that system provides real and fundamental information to users. Developing evaluation systems for agents and assistants is likely something that could or should have its own book.

   <p>Table 11.4 shows several application scenarios in which we may find an assistant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how feedback may be employed in each application:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p122"> <em>Personal assistant</em>—If the assistant or agent interacts with the user in a chat-style interface, direct and immediate feedback can be applied by the user. Whether this feedback is sustained over future conversations or interactions, it usually develops within agentic memory. Assistants such as ChatGPT now incorporate memory and can benefit from explicit user feedback. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p123"> <em>Customer service bot</em>—User or system feedback is typically provided through a survey after the interaction has completed. This usually means that feedback is regulated to an external system that aggregates the feedback for later improvements. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p124"> <em>Autonomous agent</em>—Much like bots, feedback within autonomous agents is typically regulated to after the agent has completed a task that a user then reviews. The feedback mechanism may be harder to capture because many things can be subjective. Methods explored in this chapter for producing feedback can be used within prompt engineering improvements. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p125"> <em>Collaborative workflows</em>—Similar to the personal assistant, these types of applications can benefit from immediate and direct feedback from the user. Again, how this information is persisted across sessions is often an implementation of agentic memory. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p126"> <em>Game AI</em>—Feedback can be implemented alongside evaluation through additional and multiple agents. This feedback form may again be single-use and exist within the current interaction or may persist as memory. Imagine a game AI that can evaluate its actions, improve those with feedback, and remember those improvements. While this pattern isn’t ideal for games, it will certainly improve the gameplay experience. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p127"> <em>Research</em>—Similar to evaluation in the context of research, feedback is typically performed offline after the output is evaluated. While some development has been done using multiple agent systems incorporating agents for evaluation and feedback, these systems don’t always perform well, at least not with the current state-of-the-art models. Instead, it’s often better to isolate feedback and evaluation at the end to avoid the common feedback looping problem. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p128"> &#13;
   <p>Feedback is another powerful component of agentic and assistant systems, but it’s not always required on the first release. However, incorporating rigorous feedback and evaluation mechanisms can greatly benefit agentic systems in the long term concerning ongoing monitoring and providing the confidence to improve various aspects of the system.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p129"> &#13;
   <p>How you implement each of these components in your agentic systems may, in part, be guided by the architecture of your chosen agentic platform. Now that you understand the nuances of each component, you also have the knowledge to guide you in selecting the right agent system that fits your application and business use case. Regardless of your application, you’ll want to employ several agentic components in almost all cases.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p130"> &#13;
   <p>As agentic systems mature and LLMs themselves get smarter, some of the components we today consider external may be closely integrated. We’ve already seen reasoning and planning be integrated into a model such as Strawberry. Certainly, as we approach the theoretical artificial general intelligence milestone, we may see models capable of performing long-term self-evaluation and feedback. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p131"> &#13;
   <p>In any case, I hope you enjoyed this journey with me into this incredible frontier of a new and emerging technology that will certainly alter our perception of work and how we undertake it through agents.</p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_159">Summary</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p169"> Planning is central to agents and assistants, allowing them to take a goal, break it into steps, and execute them. Without planning, agents are reduced to simple chatbot-like interactions. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p170"> Agents must differentiate between parallel and sequential actions. Many LLMs can handle parallel actions, but only advanced models support sequential planning, critical for complex task completion. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p171"> Feedback is crucial in guiding agents to correct their course and improve performance over time. This chapter demonstrates how feedback mechanisms can be integrated with agents to refine their decision-making processes. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p172"> Platforms such as OpenAI Assistants and Anthropic’s Claude support internal planning and can execute complex, multistep tasks. Agents using these platforms can use sequential action planning for sophisticated workflows. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p173"> Properly selecting and limiting agent actions is vital to avoid confusion and unintended behavior. Too many actions may overwhelm an agent, while unnecessary tools may be misused. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p174"> Nexus allows for creating and managing agents through a flexible interface, where users can implement custom planners, set goals, and assign tools. The chapter includes practical examples using Nexus to highlight the difference between a raw LLM and a planner-enhanced agent. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p175"> Writing custom planners is straightforward, using prompt engineering strategies. Tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel offer a variety of planners that can be adapted or extended to fit specific agentic needs. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p176"> Models such as OpenAI Strawberry integrate reasoning, planning, evaluation, and feedback directly into the LLM, offering more accurate problem-solving capabilities. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p177"> Evaluation helps determine how well an agentic system is performing and can be implemented internally or externally, depending on the use case. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p178"> As LLMs evolve, reasoning, planning, and feedback mechanisms may become deeply integrated into models, paving the way for more autonomous and intelligent agent systems.<span class=" link-like"/> </li> &#13;
