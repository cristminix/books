   <p>The term <em>large language models</em> (LLMs<span class="light"/>) has now become a ubiquitous descriptor of a form of AI. These LLMs have been developed using generative pretrained transformers (GPTs). While other architectures also power LLMs, the GPT form is currently the most successful.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> &#13;
   <p>LLMs and GPTs are <em>generative</em> models, which means they are trained to <em>generate</em> rather than predict or classify content. To illustrate this further, consider figure 2.1, which shows the difference between generative and predictive/classification models. Generative models create something from the input, whereas predictive and classifying models classify it.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>We can further define an LLM by its constituent parts, as shown in figure 2.2. In this diagram, <em>data</em> represents the content used to train the model, and <em>architecture</em> is an attribute of the model itself, such as the number of parameters or size of the model. Models are further trained specifically to the desired use case, including chat, completions, or instruction. Finally, <em>fine-tuning</em> is a feature added to models that refines the input data and model training to better match a particular use case or domain.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p12"> &#13;
   <p>The transformer architecture of GPTs, which is a specific architecture of LLMs, allows the models to be scaled to billions of parameters in size. This requires these large models to be trained on terabytes of documents to build a foundation. From there, these models will be successively trained using various methods for the desired use case of the model.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p13"> &#13;
   <p>ChatGPT, for example, is trained effectively on the public internet and then fine-tuned using several training strategies. The final fine-tuning training is completed using an advanced form called <em>reinforcement learning with human feedback</em> (RLHF). This produces a model use case called chat completions.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p14"> &#13;
   <p><em>Chat completions</em> LLMs are designed to improve through iteration and refinement—in other words, chatting. These models have also been benchmarked to be the best in task completion, reasoning, and planning, which makes them ideal for building agents and assistants. Completion models are trained/designed only to provide generated content on input text, so they don’t benefit from iteration.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> &#13;
   <p>For our journey to build powerful agents in this book, we focus on the class of LLMs called chat completions models. That, of course, doesn’t preclude you from trying other model forms for your agents. However, you may have to significantly alter the code samples provided to support other model forms.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p16"> &#13;
   <p>We’ll uncover more details about LLMs and GPTs later in this chapter when we look at running an open source LLM locally. In the next section, we look at how to connect to an LLM using a growing standard from OpenAI.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>Numerous AI agents and assistant projects use the OpenAI API SDK to connect to an LLM. While not standard, the basic concepts describing a connection now follow the OpenAI pattern. Therefore, we must understand the core concepts of an LLM connection using the OpenAI SDK.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p19"> &#13;
   <p>This chapter will look at connecting to an LLM model using the OpenAI Python SDK/package. We’ll discuss connecting to a GPT-4 model, the model response, counting tokens, and how to define consistent messages. Starting in the following subsection, we’ll examine how to use OpenAI.</p> &#13;

   <p>To complete the exercises in this section and subsequent ones, you must set up a Python developer environment and get access to an LLM. Appendix A walks you through setting up an OpenAI account and accessing GPT-4 or other models. Appendix B demonstrates setting up a Python development environment with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), including installing needed extensions. Review these sections if you want to follow along with the scenarios.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p22"> &#13;
   <p>Start by opening the source code <code>chapter_2</code> folder in VS Code and creating a new Python virtual environment. Again, refer to appendix B if you need assistance.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p23"> &#13;
   <p>Then, install the OpenAI and Python dot environment packages using the command in the following listing. This will install the required packages into the virtual environment.</p> &#13;

   <p>Next, open the <code>connecting.py</code> file in VS Code, and inspect the code shown in listing 2.2. Be sure to set the model’s name to an appropriate name—for example, gpt-4. At the time of writing, the <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code> was used to represent GPT-4 Turbo.</p> &#13;

   <p>A lot is happening here, so let’s break it down by section, starting with the beginning and loading the environment variables. In the <code>chapter_2</code> folder is another file called <code>.env</code>, which holds environment variables. These variables are set automatically by calling the <code>load_dotenv</code> function.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p28"> &#13;

   <p>After setting the key, you can debug the file by pressing the F5 key or selecting Run &gt; Start Debugging from the VS Code menu. This will run the code, and you should see something like “The capital of France is Paris.”</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p31"> &#13;
   <p>Remember that the response from a generative model depends on the probability. The model will probably give us a correct and consistent answer in this case.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p32"> &#13;
   <p>You can play with these probabilities by adjusting the temperature of the request. If you want a model to be more consistent, turn the temperature down to 0, but if you want the model to produce more variation, turn the temperature up. We’ll explore setting the temperature further in the next section.</p> &#13;

   <p>Within the request, the <code>messages</code> block describes a set of messages and roles used in a request. Messages for a chat completions model can be defined in three roles:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p37"> <em>System role</em> —A message that describes the request’s rules and guidelines. It can often be used to describe the role of the LLM in making the request. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p38"> <em>User role</em> —Represents and contains the message from the user. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p39"> <em>Assistant role</em> —Can be used to capture the message history of previous responses from the LLM. It can also inject a message history when perhaps none existed. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;

   <p>You can see how this can be applied by opening <code>message_history.py</code> in VS Code and debugging it by pressing F5. After the file runs, be sure to check the output. Then, try to run the sample a few more times to see how the results change.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p43"> &#13;
   <p>The results will change from each run to the next due to the high temperature of <code>.7</code>. Go ahead and reduce the temperature to <code>.0</code>, and run the <code>message_history.py</code> sample a few more times. Keeping the temperature at <code>0</code> will show the same or similar results each time.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p44"> &#13;
   <p>Setting a request’s temperature will often depend on your particular use case. Sometimes, you may want to limit the responses’ stochastic nature (randomness). Reducing the temperature to <code>0</code> will give consistent results. Likewise, a value of <code>1.0</code> will give the most variability in the responses.</p> &#13;

   <p>It can be helpful to track the number of <em>input tokens</em> (those used in prompts) and the <em>output tokens</em> (the number returned through completions). Sometimes, minimizing and reducing the number of tokens can be essential. Having fewer tokens typically means LLM interactions will be cheaper, respond faster, and produce better and more consistent results.</p> &#13;

   <p>Commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4 from OpenAI, are an excellent place to start to learn how to use modern AI and build agents. However, commercial agents are an external resource that comes at a cost, reduces data privacy and security, and introduces dependencies. Other external influences can further complicate these factors.</p> &#13;

   <p>Enter some text to search for a model, and click Go. You’ll be taken to the search page interface, as shown in figure 2.4. From this page, you can see all the model variations and other specifications, such as context token size. After you click the Compatibility Guess button, the software will even tell you if the model will run on your system.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Chatting with a model and using or playing with various prompts can help you determine how well a model will work for your given use case. A more systematic approach is using the prompt flow tool for evaluating prompts and LLMs. We’ll describe how to use prompt flow in chapter 9.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p78"> &#13;
   <p>A prompt defined for LLMs is the message content used in the request for better response output. <em>Prompt engineering</em> is a new and emerging field that attempts to structure a methodology for building prompts. Unfortunately, prompt building isn’t a well-established science, and there is a growing and diverse set of methods defined as prompt engineering.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p79"> &#13;
   <p>Fortunately, organizations such as OpenAI have begun documenting a universal set of strategies, as shown in figure 2.8. These strategies cover various tactics, some requiring additional infrastructure and considerations. As such, the prompt engineering strategies relating to more advanced concepts will be covered in the indicated chapters.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Each strategy in figure 2.8 unfolds into tactics that can further refine the specific method of prompt engineering. This chapter will examine the fundamental Write Clear Instructions strategy. Figure 2.9 shows the tactics for this strategy in more detail, along with examples for each tactic. We’ll look at running these examples using a code demo in the following sections.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p83"> &#13;
   <p>The Write Clear Instructions strategy is about being careful and specific about what you ask for. Asking an LLM to perform a task is no different from asking a person to complete the same task. Generally, the more information and context relevant to a task you can specify in a request, the better the response.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p84"> &#13;
   <p>This strategy has been broken down into specific tactics you can apply to prompts. To understand how to use those, a code demo (<code>prompt_engineering.py</code>) with various prompt examples is in the <code>chapter 2</code> source code folder.</p> &#13;

   <p>Specifying steps is another powerful tactic that can have many uses, including in agents, as shown in listing 2.12. It’s especially powerful when developing prompts or agent profiles for complex multistep tasks. You can specify steps to break down these complex prompts into a step-by-step process that the LLM can follow. In turn, these steps can guide the LLM through multiple interactions over a more extended conversation and many iterations.</p> &#13;

   <p>Providing examples can also be used to request a particular output format from a complex series of tasks that derive the output.

   <p>The tactic of specifying output length can be helpful in not just limiting tokens but also in guiding the output to a desired format. Listing 2.14 shows an example of using two different techniques for this tactic. The first limits the output to fewer than 10 words. This can have the added benefit of making the response more concise and directed, which can be desirable for some use cases. The second example demonstrates limiting output to a concise set of bullet points. This method can help narrow down the output and keep answers short. More concise answers generally mean the output is more focused and contains less filler.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p120"> &#13;
   <p>While being a successful crafter of AI agents doesn’t require an in-depth understanding of LLMs, it’s helpful to be able to evaluate the specifications. Like a computer user, you don’t need to know how to build a processor to understand the differences in processor models. This analogy holds well for LLMs, and while the criteria may be different, it still depends on some primary considerations.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p121"> &#13;
   <p>From our previous discussion and look at LM Studio, we can extract some fundamental criteria that will be important to us when considering LLMs. <span class="aframe-location"/>Figure 2.11 explains the essential criteria to define what makes an LLM worth considering for creating a GPT agent or any LLM task.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p122">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 2.11</span> The important criteria to consider when consuming an LLM</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p123"> &#13;
   <p>For our purposes of building AI agents, we need to look at each of these criteria in terms related to the task. Model context size and speed could be considered the sixth and seventh criteria, but they are usually considered variations of a model deployment architecture and infrastructure. An eighth criterion to consider for an LLM is cost, but this depends on many other factors. Here is a summary of how these criteria relate to building AI agents:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ul> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p124"> <em>Model performance</em> —You’ll generally want to understand the LLM’s performance for a given set of tasks. For example, if you’re building an agent specific to coding, then an LLM that performs well on code will be essential. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p125"> <em>Model parameters (size)</em> —The size of a model is often an excellent indication of inference performance and how well the model responds. However, the size of a model will also dictate your hardware requirements. If you plan to use your own locally hosted model, the model size will also primarily dictate the computer and GPU you need. Fortunately, we’re seeing small, very capable open source models being released regularly. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p126"> <em>Use case (model type)</em> —The type of model has several variations. Chat completions models such as ChatGPT are effective for iterating and reasoning through a problem, whereas models such as completion, question/answer, and instruct are more related to specific tasks. A chat completions model is essential for agent applications, especially those that iterate. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p127"> <em>Training input</em> —Understanding the content used to train a model will often dictate the domain of a model. While general models can be effective across tasks, more specific or fine-tuned models can be more relevant to a domain. This may be a consideration for a domain-specific agent where a smaller, more fine-tuned model may perform as well as or better than a larger model such as GPT-4. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p128"> <em>Training method</em> —It’s perhaps less of a concern, but it can be helpful to understand what method was used to train a model. How a model is trained can affect its ability to generalize, reason, and plan. This can be essential for planning agents but perhaps less significant for agents than for a more task-specific assistant. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p129"> <em>Context token size</em> —The context size of a model is more specific to the model architecture and type. It dictates the size of context or memory the model may hold. A smaller context window of less than 4,000 tokens is typically more than enough for simple tasks. However, a large context window can be essential when using multiple agents—all conversing over a task. The models will typically be deployed with variations on the context window size. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p130"> <em>Model speed (model deployment)</em> —The speed of a model is dictated by its <em>inference speed</em> (or how fast a model replies to a request), which in turn is dictated by the infrastructure it runs on. If your agent isn’t directly interacting with users, raw real-time speed may not be necessary. On the other hand, an LLM agent interacting in real time needs to be as quick as possible. For commercial models, speed will be determined and supported by the provider. Your infrastructure will determine the speed for those wanting to run their LLMs. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p131"> <em>Model cost (project budget)</em> —The cost is often dictated by the project. Whether learning to build an agent or implementing enterprise software, cost is always a consideration. A significant tradeoff exists between running your LLMs versus using a commercial API. </li> &#13;
  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p132"> &#13;
   <p>There is a lot to consider when choosing which model you want to build a production agent system on. However, picking and working with a single model is usually best for research and learning purposes. If you’re new to LLMs and agents, you’ll likely want to choose a commercial option such as GPT-4 Turbo. Unless otherwise stated, the work in this book will depend on GPT-4 Turbo.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p133"> &#13;
   <p>Over time, models will undoubtedly be replaced by better models. So you may need to upgrade or swap out models. To do this, though, you must understand the performance metrics of your LLMs and agents. Fortunately, in chapter 9, we’ll explore evaluating LLMs, prompts, and agent profiles with prompt flow.</p> &#13;
