   <p>Now let’s take a journey from AutoGen to CrewAI, two well-established multi-agent platforms. We’ll start with AutoGen, a Microsoft project that supports multiple agents and provides a studio for working with them. We’ll explore a project from Microsoft called AutoGen, which supports multiple agents but also provides a studio to ease you into working with agents. From there, we’ll get more hands-on coding of AutoGen agents to solve tasks using conversations and group chat collaborations. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p8"> &#13;
   <p>Then, we’ll transition to CrewAI, a self-proposed enterprise agentic system that takes a different approach. CrewAI balances role-based and autonomous agents that can be sequentially or hierarchically flexible task management systems. We’ll explore how CrewAI can solve diverse and complex problems.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p9"> &#13;
   <p>Multi-agent systems incorporate many of the same tools single-agent systems use but benefit from the ability to provide outside feedback and evaluation to other agents. This ability to support and criticize agent solutions internally gives multi-agent systems more power. We’ll explore an introduction to multi-agent systems, beginning with AutoGen Studio in the next section.</p> &#13;

   <h2 class="readable-text-h2" id="sigil_toc_id_41"><span class="num-string">4.1</span> Introducing multi-agent systems with AutoGen Studio</h2> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p11"> &#13;
   <p>AutoGen Studio is a powerful tool that employs multiple agents behind the scenes to solve tasks and problems a user directs. This tool has been used to develop some of the more complex code in this book. For that reason and others, it’s an excellent introduction to a practical multi-agent system.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p12"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 4.1 shows a schematic diagram of the agent connection/communication patterns AutoGen employs. AutoGen is a conversational multi-agent platform because communication is done using natural language. Natural language conversation seems to be the most natural pattern for agents to communicate, but it’s not the only method, as you’ll see later.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p13">  &#13;

   <h5 class="figure-container-h5 sigil_not_in_toc"><span class="num-string">Figure 4.1</span> How AutoGen agents communicate through conversations (Source: AutoGen)</h5>&#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p14"> &#13;
   <p>AutoGen supports various conversational patterns, from group and hierarchical to the more common and simpler proxy communication. In proxy communication, one agent acts as a proxy and directs communication to relevant agents to complete tasks. A proxy is similar to a waiter taking orders and delivering them to the kitchen, which cooks the food. Then, the waiter serves the cooked food.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p15"> &#13;
   <p>The basic pattern in AutoGen uses a <code>UserProxy</code> and one or more assistant agents. Figure 4.2 shows the user proxy taking direction from a human and then directing an assistant agent enabled to write code to perform the tasks. Each time the assistant completes a task, the proxy agent reviews, evaluates, and provides feedback to the assistant. This iteration loop continues until the proxy is satisfied with the results.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container figure-container" id="p16">  &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p17"> &#13;
   <p>The benefit of the proxy is that it works to replace the required human feedback and evaluation, and, in most cases, it does a good job. While it doesn’t eliminate the need for human feedback and evaluation, it produces much more complete results overall. And, while the iteration loop is time consuming, it’s time you could be drinking a coffee or working on other tasks.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p18"> &#13;
   <p>AutoGen Studio is a tool developed by the AutoGen team that provides a helpful introduction to conversable agents. In the next exercise, we’ll install Studio and run some experiments to see how well the platform performs. These tools are still in a rapid development cycle, so if you encounter any problems, consult the documentation on the AutoGen GitHub repository.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p20"> &#13;
   <p>Open the <code>chapter_04</code> folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), create a local Python virtual environment, and install the <code>requirements.txt</code> file. If you need assistance with this, consult appendix B to install all of this chapter’s exercise requirements.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p21"> &#13;
   <p>Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl-`, Cmd-`) pointing to your virtual environment, and run AutoGen Studio using the command shown in listing 4.1. You’ll first need to define an environment variable for your OpenAI key. Because ports 8080 and 8081 are popular, and if you have other services running, change the port to 8082 or something you choose.</p> &#13;

   <p>Navigate your browser to the AutoGen Studio interface shown in figure 4.3 (as of this writing). While there may be differences, one thing is for sure: the primary interface will still be chat. Enter a complex task that requires coding. The example used here is <code>Create</code> <code>a</code> <code>plot</code> <code>showing</code> <code>the</code> <code>popularity</code> <code>of</code> <code>the</code> <code>term</code> <code>GPT</code> <code>Agents</code> <code>in</code> <code>Google</code> <code>search.<span class="aframe-location"/></code></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p25"> &#13;
   <p>The agent assistant generates code snippets to perform or complete various subtasks as the agents work together through the task in the example. The user proxy agent then attempts to execute those code snippets and assesses the output. In many cases, proving the code runs and produces the required output is sufficient for the user proxy agent to approve the task’s completion.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p26"> &#13;
   <p>If you encounter any problems with the assistant agent requests, ask the proxy agent to try a different method or another problem. This highlights a bigger problem with agentic systems using packages or libraries that have expired and no longer work. For this reason, it’s generally better to get agents to execute actions rather than build code to perform actions as tools.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p27"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Tip</span>  Executing AutoGen and AutoGen Studio using Docker is recommended, especially when working with code that may affect the operating system. Docker can isolate and virtualize the agents’ environment, thus isolating potentially harmful code. Using Docker can help alleviate any secondary windows or websites that may block the agent process from running. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p28"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 4.4 shows the agent’s completion of the task. The proxy agent will collect any generated code snippet, images, or other documents and append<span class="aframe-location"/> them to the message. You can also review the agent conversation by opening the Agent Messages expander. In many cases, if you ask the agent to generate plots or applications, secondary windows will open showing those results.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p30"> &#13;
   <p>Amazingly, the agents will perform most tasks nicely and complete them well. Depending on the complexity of the task, you may need to further iterate with the proxy. Sometimes, an agent may only go so far to complete a task because it lacks the required skills. In the next section, we’ll look at how to add skills to agents.</p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p32"> &#13;
   <p>Skills and tools, or <em>actions,</em> as we refer to them in this book, are the primary means by which agents can extend themselves. Actions give agents the ability to execute code, call APIs, or even further evaluate and inspect generated output. AutoGen Studio currently begins with just a basic set of tools to fetch web content or generate images.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text print-book-callout" id="p33"> &#13;
   <p><span class="print-book-callout-head">Note </span> Many agentic systems employ the practice of allowing agents to code to solve goals. However, we discovered that code can be easily broken, needs to be maintained, and can change quickly. Therefore, as we’ll discuss in later chapters, it’s better to provide agents with skills/actions/tools to solve problems. </p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p34"> &#13;
   <p>In the following exercise scenario, we’ll add a skill/action to inspect an image using the OpenAI vision model. This will allow the proxy agent to provide feedback if we ask the assistant to generate an image with particular content.</p> &#13;

   <p>The <code>describe_image</code> function uses the OpenAI GPT-4 vision model to describe what is in the image. This skill can be paired with the existing generate_image skill as a quality assessment. The agents can confirm that the generated image matches the user’s requirements.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p40"> &#13;
   <p>After the skill is added, it must be added to the specific agent workflow and agent for use. Figure 4.6 demonstrates adding the new skill to the primary assistant agent in the general or default agent workflow. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p70"> &#13;
   <p>AutoGen can consume many tokens over chat iterations as a conversable multi-agent platform. If you ask AutoGen to work through complex or novel problems, you may even encounter token limits on your LLM; because of this, AutoGen supports several methods to reduce token usage.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p71"> &#13;
   <p>AutoGen uses caching to store progress and reduce token usage. Caching is enabled by default, and you may have already encountered it. If you check your current working folder, you’ll notice a <code>.cache</code> folder, as shown in figure 4.8. Caching allows your agents to continue conversations if they get interrupted.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>In code, you can control the cache folder for your agent’s run, as shown in listing 4.9. By wrapping the <code>initiate_chat</code> call with the <code>with</code> statement, you can control the location and seed for the cache. This will allow you to save and return to long-running AutoGen tasks in the future by just setting the <code>cache_seed</code> for the previous cache.</p> &#13;

   <p>One problem with chat delegation and nested chats or conversations is the conveyance of information. If you’ve ever played the telephone game, you’ve witnessed this firsthand and experienced how quickly information can change over iterations. With agents, this is certainly no different, and chatting through nested or sequential conversations can alter the task or even the desired result.</p> &#13;

   <div class="readable-text" id="p79"> &#13;
    <p>The telephone game is a fun but educational game that demonstrates information and coherence loss. Children form a line, and the first child receives a message only they can hear. Then, in turn, the children verbally pass the message on to the next child, and so on. At the end, the last child announces the message to the whole group, which often isn’t even close to the same message.</p> &#13;
   </div> &#13;
   <div class="readable-text" id="p80"> &#13;
    <p>To counter this, AutoGen provides a group chat, a mechanism by which agents participate in a shared conversation. This allows agents to review all past conversations and better collaborate on long-running and complex tasks.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p81"> &#13;

  </ul> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p107"> &#13;
   <p>Before you run more iterations of the joke crew, you should read the next section. This section shows how to add observability to the multi-agent system.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p108"> &#13;
   <h3 class="readable-text-h3" id="sigil_toc_id_51"><span class="num-string">4.4.2</span> Observing agents working with AgentOps</h3> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p109"> &#13;
   <p>Observing a complex assemblage such as a multi-agent system is critical to understanding the myriad of problems that can happen. Observability through application tracing is a key element of any complex system, especially one engaged in enterprise use.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p110"> &#13;
   <p>CrewAI supports connecting to a specialized agent operations platform appropriately called AgentOps. This observability platform is generic and designed to support observability with any agent platform specific to LLM usage. Currently, no pricing or commercialization details are available.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p111"> &#13;
   <p>Connecting to AgentOps is as simple as installing the package, getting an API key, and adding a line of code to your crew setup. This next exercise will go through the steps to connect and run AgentOps.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p112"> &#13;
   <p>Listing 4.14 shows installing the <code>agentops</code> package using <code>pip</code>. You can install the package alone or as an additional component of the <code>crewai</code> package. Remember that AgentOps can also be connected to other agent platforms for observability.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;

   </div> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p114"> &#13;
   <p>Before using AgentOps, you need to sign up for an API key. Following are the general steps to sign up for a key at the time of writing:</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <ol> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p115"> Visit <a href="https://app.agentops.ai">https://app.agentops.ai</a> in your browser. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p116"> Sign up for an account. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p117"> Create a project, or use the default. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p118"> Go to Settings &gt; Projects and API Keys. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p119"> Copy and/or generate a new API key; this will copy the key to your browser. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p120"> Paste the key to your <code>.env</code> file in your project. </li> &#13;
  </ol> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p121"> &#13;
   <p>After the API key is copied, it should resemble the example shown in the following listing.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="browsable-container listing-container" id="p122"> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p123"> &#13;
   <p>Now, we need to add a few lines of code to the CrewAI script. Listing 4.16 shows the additions as they are added to the <code>crewai_agentops.py</code> file. When creating your own scripts, all you need to do is add the <code>agentops</code> package and initialize it when using CrewAI.</p> &#13;

   <p>Run the <code>crewai_agentops.py</code> file in VS Code (F5), and watch the agents work as before. However, you can now go to the AgentOps dashboard and view the agent interactions at various levels.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p126"> &#13;
   <p>Figure 4.11 shows the dashboard for running the joke crew to create the best joke. Several statistics include total duration, the run environment, prompt and completion tokens, LLM call timings, and estimated cost. Seeing the cost can be both sobering and indicative of how verbose agent conversations can become.<span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text" id="p128"> &#13;
   <p>The AgentOps platform is an excellent addition to any agent platform. While it’s built into CrewAI, it’s helpful that the observability could be added to AutoGen or other frameworks. Another attractive thing about AgentOps is that it’s dedicated to observing agent interactions and not transforming from a machine learning operations platform. In the future, we’ll likely see the spawn of more agent observability patterns.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p129"> &#13;
   <p>One benefit that can’t be overstated is the cost observation that an observability platform can provide. Did you notice in figure 4.11 that creating a single joke costs a little over 50 cents? Agents can be very powerful, but they can also become very costly, and it’s essential to observe what those costs are in terms of practicality and commercialization.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p130"> &#13;
   <p>In the last section of this chapter, we’ll return to CrewAI and revisit building agents that can code games. This will provide an excellent comparison between the capabilities of AutoGen and CrewAI.</p> &#13;

Each agent and task are added, as well as the verbose and process attributes. For this example, we’ll continue to use sequential methods. </p> &#13;

   <p>When you run the VS Code (F5) file, you’ll be prompted to enter the instructions for writing a game. Enter some instructions, perhaps the snake game or another game you choose. Then, let the agents work, and observe what they produce.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p140"> &#13;
   <p>With the addition of the chief QA engineer, the results will generally look better than what was produced with AutoGen, at least out of the box. If you review the code, you’ll see that it generally follows good patterns and, in some cases, may even include tests and unit tests.</p> &#13;

   <p>Before we finish the chapter, we’ll make one last change to the crew’s processing pattern. Previously, we employed sequential processing, as shown in figure 4.10. Figure 4.12 shows what hierarchical processing looks like in CrewAI. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

   <p>Adding this manager is a relatively simple process. Listing 4.20 shows the additional code changes to a new file that uses the coding crew in a hierarchical method.

   <p>Run this file in VS Code (F5). When prompted, enter a game you want to create. Try using the same game you tried with AutoGen; the snake game is also a good baseline example. Observe the agents work through the code and review it repeatedly for problems.</p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p146"> &#13;
   <p>After you run the file, you can also jump on AgentOps to review the cost of this run. Chances are, it will cost over double what it would have without the agent manager. The output will also likely not be significantly better. This is the trap of building agent systems without understanding how quickly things can spiral.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p147"> &#13;
   <p>An example of this spiral that often happens when agents continually iterate over the same actions is frequently repeating tasks. You can view this problem in AgentOps, as shown in figure 4.13, by viewing the Repeat Thoughts plot. <span class="aframe-location"/></p> &#13;

  <div class="readable-text" id="p149"> &#13;
   <p>The Repeat Thoughts plot from AgentOps is an excellent way to measure the repetition your agent system encounters. Overly repetitive thought patterns typically mean the agent isn’t being decisive enough and instead keeps trying to generate a different answer. If you encounter this problem, you want to change the agents’ processing patterns, tasks, and goals. You may even want to alter the system’s type and number of agents.</p> &#13;
  </div> &#13;
  <div class="readable-text intended-text" id="p150"> &#13;
   <p>Multi-agent systems are an excellent way to break up work in terms of work patterns of jobs and tasks. Generally, the job role is allocated to an agent role/persona, and the tasks it needs to complete may be implicit, as in AutoGen, or more explicit, as in CrewAI.</p> &#13;

   <li class="readable-text" id="p186"> AutoGen supports multiple communication patterns, including group chats and hierarchical and proxy communications. Proxy communication involves a primary agent (proxy) that interfaces between the user and other agents to streamline task completion. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p187"> CrewAI offers a structured approach to building multi-agent systems with a focus on enterprise applications. It emphasizes role-based and autonomous agent functionalities, allowing for flexible, sequential, or hierarchical task management. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p188"> Practical exercises in the chapter illustrate how to set up and use AutoGen Studio, including installing necessary components and running basic multi-agent systems. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p189"> Agents in AutoGen can be equipped with specific skills to perform tasks such as code generation, image analysis, and data retrieval, thereby broadening their application scope. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p190"> CrewAI is distinguished by its ability to structure agent interactions more rigidly than AutoGen, which can be advantageous in settings that require precise and controlled agent behavior. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p191"> CrewAI supports integrating memory and tools for agents to consume through task completion. </li> &#13;
   <li class="readable-text" id="p192"> CrewAI supports integration with observability tools such as AgentOps, which provides insights into agent performance, interaction efficiency, and cost management. </li> &#13;
