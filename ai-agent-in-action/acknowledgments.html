   <p>I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the machine learning and deep learning communities for their tireless dedication and incredible work. Just a few short years ago, many questioned whether the field was headed for another AI winter—a period of stagnation and doubt. But thanks to the persistence, brilliance, and passion of countless individuals, the field not only persevered but also flourished. We’re standing on the threshold of an AI-driven future, and I am endlessly grateful for the contributions of this talented community.</p> &#13;

   <p>Writing a book, even with the help of AI, is no small feat. It takes dedication, collaboration, and a tremendous amount of support. I am incredibly thankful to the team of editors and reviewers who made this book possible. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who took the time to review and provide feedback. In particular, I want to thank Becky Whitney, my content editor, and Ross Turner, my technical editor and chief production and technology officer at OpenSC, for their dedication, as well as the whole production team at Manning for their insight and unwavering support throughout this journey.</p> &#13;

   <p>To my partner, Rhonda—your love, patience, and encouragement mean the world to me. You’ve been the cornerstone of my support system, not just for this book but for all the books that have come before. I truly couldn’t have done any of this without you. Thank you for being my rock, my partner, and my inspiration.</p> &#13;

   <p>Many of the early ideas for this book grew out of my work at Symend. It was during my time there that I first began developing the concepts and designs for agentic systems that laid the foundation for this book. I am deeply grateful to my colleagues at Symend for their collaboration and contributions, including Peh Teh, Andrew Wright, Ziko Rajabali, Chris Garrett, Kouros, Fatemeh Torabi Asr, Sukh Singh, and Hanif Joshaghani. Your insights and hard work helped bring these ideas to life, and I am honored to have worked alongside such an incredible group of people.</p> &#13;
